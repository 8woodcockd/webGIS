<h1>Adding Photo's</h1>
<p>
Too add a photo to your page use the following. You must put some text in the alt attribute otherwise the website will not validate.
 <p>

<img src="photo1.png" alt="Text" style = "width:450px;height:50px">

 <p>
Alternatively the style for the image can be manipulated in CSS.
 <p>
You can also use an image as a hyperlink. For this you need to use the <a> tag like so:
 <p>
<img src="photo2.png" alt="Text" style = "width:450px;height:100px">
<p>


</body></html>
