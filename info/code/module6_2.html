<h1>Polylines</h1>
<p>
The basic <a href="Basic Google Map.html">google map</a> (which
is fully commented) is taken from <a
href="http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/gmaps_instruction/exercise01.html">
Harvard Uni Google Maps Tutorial</a>.  Explore this resource, it's a good refresher on what we have covered.
<p>
Copy the code below and paste it in into your file directly after line 36. This code will draw a red line from California to Maine to Texas.
<p>
    <p>
<img src="example6_9.png" alt="Text" style = "width:650px;height:200px">
<p>

Have a look at the map - have the lines appeared?
<p>
You should have something like this:

<p>
<img src="example6_10.png" alt="Text" style = "width:800px;height:600px">
<p>

<ul>
    <li>Change the latitude, longitude values of your polyline to draw the line where you want.

    <li>Add new verticies to the line by copying and pasting in additional "new google.maps.LatLng(45.65654,-71)," lines, and changing the coordinate values. Make sure each new line ends with a comma, except for the last one that has no comma.

    <li>Change the colour of the line to gray by changing the "#FF0000" to "#110022". This is a hexadecimal colour reference. To see other colour codes, go <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_colornames.asp">here</a>.

    <li>Change the thickness of the line by changing the number after the "strokeWeight:" control. Change the opacity of the line by changing the number after the "strokeOpacity:" control.
</ul>
