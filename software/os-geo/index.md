##OSGEO Live

For parts of this course we will be using a customised version of the Ubuntu
operating system, based on Linux. [OSGEO Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html)
contains dozens of GIS programs with the advantage that they are all upgradeable and
set-up to work well together.

## Installation

- We will be using the 'virtual machine' option from the
[OSGEO Live Download page](http://live.osgeo.org/en/download.html).
- This must be unzipped onto a large enough disk (10 Gb free minimum)
that has the right disk format (FAT32 will not work) - we recommend NTFS.
- Then you need install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
- Open the VirtualBox program, add a new machine, and run the virtual machine file
in the 'osgeo' directory.
- These steps are explained clearly on the [OSGEO Live website](http://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html) so we recommend following their tutorial
for the details.
