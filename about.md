## About the website

<p class="message">
 Welcome the the Web GIS website, for MSc students in the School of Geography,

 help from static website generator

 It is based on the
 <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon Template</a>.

## About the course

Web GIS, quite simply, is about building, displaying and interacting with
online maps.
