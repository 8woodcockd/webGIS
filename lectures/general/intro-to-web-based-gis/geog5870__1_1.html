<h2>Google Maps:
History and features<br>
</h2>
<p>

We start with a brief
history of the introduction of <a href = "https://www.google.co.uk/maps/"> Google
Maps</a>. Google
introduced their mapping service in February 2005. Prior to this,
a
variety of other providers had created map-based services, including
<a href="www.multimap.com">MultiMap</a> and <a href="www.streetmap.co.uk">StreetMap</a> in the
UK, and <a href="www.mapquest.com">MapQuest</a> in
the US. The level of services that were
available
from these providers varied - typical features included the ability to
produce
driving instructions and to search for locations of businesses, but for
the most part the provision of these services was fairly
simple: maps could be created that were centred on a chosen location. Limited panning and zooming capabilities were included.
The introduction of Google Maps was significant for a number
of reasons:</p>


<ol>

  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brand
recognition</span> - regardless of the technical merits of the
system, Google had the advantage of massive brand recognition, both
within technical communities and with the general public.</p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interface quality</span> - Google Maps offered a slicker
interface than the majority of competitors did at the time.
Rather
than having to repeatedly click on zoom or pan controls, the map could
be zoomed using a mouse wheel, and panned by dragging the mouse.
In addition the overall presentation of the interface
maintained Google's house style of simple layouts with minimal
additional text.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data
availability</span> - Google had licensed a range of high quality
map base data, including both road data and satellite imagery.
Whilst this had also been true of competitors, Google scored
an initial victory by offering higher resolution satellite data than
their competitors. In addition, the road data was high
quality vector data, allowing easy control over zooming and clear
presentation. By contrast, competitors such as Streetmap
featured composite images from printed maps which looked over-busy in
comparison.<br>

    </p>
  </li>

  
  
</ol>
<p>

However, over and above these factors, another feature of
Google Maps
quickly emerged as being highly significant. An Application
Programming Interface (API) was made available, which allowed any user
of the system (subject to registration) to interact with the back end
servers. &nbsp;A community of interested users quickly developed
and began keenly experimenting with the system.<br>

allows you to see old versions of a large
number of websites through an application called the Wayback Machine.

<p>When did the site start to look like it's current incarnation?<br>

When the service was first introduced, the data set
covered
the US
only, although this was quickly expanded to include other countries,
including the UK. The level of provision of data remains
variable, as it is dependent on Google's ability to license data (and
indeed, the existence of appropriate data in the first place) for
inclusion in the mapping service. Remotely sensed data - of
varying levels of resolution - is available for most of the planet, and is generally no more than three years old. As of 2014, most parts of the globe have some degree of
coverage, with exceptions tending to be countries of a politically
sensitive nature: thus there is very limited road network data or place name information for North Korea, although
there is remotely sensed imagery; there is some place name data for
Afghanistan, but only very limited road network data.</p>

Like all maps,
Google Maps are based on a selected <span style="font-style: italic;">datum</span>
and use a
certain <span style="font-style: italic;">projection</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>As you probably remember from Principles of GIS, a
map datum is a reference ellipsoid, which is assumed to be
curved
in a similar way to the Earth's surface. The Earth is not
perfectly spherical - it is slightly flattened at the poles. However, neither is it a perfect ellipsoid: for different parts
of the Earth's surface different ellipsoids will offer the closest
match to the actual surface; for this reason different national mapping
agencies will select differing datums as the base for their maps.
The datum also offers a reference surface from which local
surface elevations are measured. A datum that is a close
match in
one particular region may not be such a good match elsewhere in the
world. However, a number of datums exist that provide
relatively
good coverage across the whole of the globe. Google Maps is
(now)
a global data collection, and thus a global level datum is required.
The datum used is based on WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984); this
datum is widely used, including being the datum used
by the
Global
Positioning System (GPS).</p>
<p>A map projection is a method used to draw the curved surface
of the
Earth (or, data collected using a co-ordinate system based on
a
selected datum). There are three main groups of projections:
planar, conic and cylindrical, which each have there own merits and
their own disadvantages, and offer greater or lesser distortion in
terms of factors such as area, shape, direction and scale. As
with a choice of datum, if one is interested only in one particular country
or region, then there may be projections that offer little distortion
for the area in question. However, for a global map, a choice
of
projection will require some aspects to become highly distorted. The
projection used by Google Maps is a Mercator projection, as illustrated
in Figure 1, which shows a map from Google zoomed out to global scale
(Fig 1a) and Mercator's 1569 map of the world (Fig 1b). The
Mercator projection - developed in the 16th
Century offers correct bearings at all points, and thus
became
very widely used for nautical purposes, and subsequently widely used
for many other purposes. The Mercator projection's flaw are
well
recognised. It suffers from distortions of size with
increasing
latitude; thus for example Greenland appears to be much larger than it
actually is when compared to other countries closer to the equator.</p>
