<h1>Google Maps: An Introduction</h1>

<p>
<h2>Map view</h2>

<p>
The default view, 'Map' includes street data and other
transport links,
place names and basic topographic features including rivers, lakes and
parkland areas. National borders are marked, as are
sub-national borders in some areas. Most features have
thresholds set for the scale at which they will start to appear on the
map - in other words, as the user zooms in, more features are shown.</p>
<p>The following figures show an example of Google Maps in the
default 'Map'
mode, illustrating some of these features. The first map is from 2011 and centred so as to
show parts of both Britain and France, and some differences in
appearance of the two countries can be seen. Note the
different road style used on either side of the English Channel.
It can just be seen that French region boundaries are
included; by contrast English county boundaries are not shown.

The second figure is of the same region taken in 2014.  The road styles are not so different in this version.  Can you see any other differences?

It can
also be seen that local place name spellings - such as 'Oostende' are
used in each relevant country, rather than universally using English spelling
variants. Where the primary name is not written in a Latin alphabet,
local scripts are used, usually together with transliterations of the local
spelling - see for example the labelling of Athens.</p>

<p>A general problem faced by anyone trying to compile international
maps is that
maps are not an objective representation of truth, but rather have to
take into account disputed features including borders and place names.
In
some cases, alternative names are shown on the
map: for example 'Londonderry / Derry' is used as a label, and three
alternate spellings are given for the national label of Switzerland.
Clearly, these two examples represent different issues: the former the
politicised area of disputed place names, and the latter an
administrative issue of alternative language uses. Alternative versions
of international borders might also be shown -
look for example at Cyprus or Israel - although this becomes confusing
when you note that these are maps without a key. 

<p>In some instances,
Google appear to have ducked the question of how to name a location,
perhaps reflecting the fact that they are a commercial organisation,
keen not to upset investors or affect advertising income: an example of this
was the body of water between Japan, China and the Korean
peninsula: this is variously called the Sea of Japan, the East Sea or
the East Sea of Korea (by Japan, South Korea and North Korea
respectively), yet until 2013 it remained resolutely unlabelled (it is now labelled as the Sea of Japan).<br>
<p>

In addition, in 2013 Palestine was formally recognised in Google Maps and in 2014, Google Maps also updated the border between Russia - Crimea reflecting the ongoing dispute.
<p>

<h2 >Satellite/Earth
view</h2>



<p>A popular feature of Google Maps is the
integration of high
quality aerial imagery. This is labelled as 'satellite' (Earth) view, although
in fact it contains both remotely sensed satellite imagery and higher
resolution imagery captured through aerial photography. Figure 4 shows a
'satellite' image of Red Square in Moscow; the
use of local labelling for streets is illustrated in the image.<p>
 <img src = "geog5870_1_2_files/gmap_satview1.gif" height="400" width="600">
<p>

<p>Satellite imagery has been demonstrated to be subject to
censorship by Google (or upstream data suppliers) in some cases, although the extent to which this
has occurred is disputed. In some cases, Google are believed
to
have changed aerial imagery following requests from national
governments (images of Basra in southern Iraq in January 2007 are often cited) whereas
in other cases modifications may have been made by the data holders
prior to the data being licensed by Google.</p>
<p>Images have been removed in some locations and blurred in others;
the following figure shows an example of such blurring from 2009, the image shows
(or doesn't!) the <a href="http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/">Huis ten
Bosch</a>, one of the official residences of the Dutch royal family.
Non-blurred parts can be seen near the top of the image. [<span
style="font-weight: bold;">Update October 2014</span>: This location is
no longer subject to blurring!].

 <p>
 Prominent sites such as the White House, GCHQ, the Pentagon etc do appear on Google Maps uncensored.  However, the data used is generally out of date.
 Further information about alleged
blurring and removal of satellite imagery can be found at <a

Satellite_map_images_with_missing_or_unclear_data">http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Satellite_map_images_with_missing_or_unclear_data</a></p>
<p>Previous versions of the Google Maps interface have included
a 'Hybrid'
mode, in which satellite imagery is shown, with surface feature
information (such as roads) overlain on the image. This mode
has been removed, and instead labels automatically appear in this mode.
</p>

<h2>Terrain view</h2>

<p>An additional view style is the 'Terrain' mode; the following figure
shows the terrain view of the Lake District. This was initially offered as an
alternative to the Map and Satellite/Earth views, but is now made available
as an optional layer whilst using the Map view. A shaded relief map is
used in conjunction with the standard maps of roads and other surface
features. In a similar manner to the default map and
satellite view, higher resolution images are used as the user zooms in.
Whilst roads are included in the terrain map, they are shown
with less prominence than is the case with the default map
view.
