<h1>General: Attacks against Business</h1>


 <P>
 A popular attack over the years has been the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial of Sevice (DoS)</A> attack. These were classically 
 run by just making massive numbers of repeated page requests to a server from a single machine, blocking 
other users and (in some cases) overloading machines. However, most servers now recognise rapidly repeated requests from the 
 same IP address as a potential attack and refuse to serve to that address. Attacks of this nature 
are now generally more sophisticated than this, but broadly still work by flooding in requests of some type. Recently 
 the attacks have come from networks of people who sign up to run attack scripts, or, often, from machines that have previously been compromised: so-called 
 <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_%28computer_science%29">Zombies</A>, which are used to make 
 <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">Botnets</A>. Such <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack">Distributed DoS attacks</A> are 
 generally used for punishing percieved wrongdoing or for blackmail, though are occasionally used to keep systems administrators busy while other attacks are done.

The main reason for understanding DoS attacks is to avoid accidentally doing them yourself. For example, when polling websites for changes, it is fairly 
easy to make requests so frequently of a site that the server locks you out as a potential DoS. Of course, it is also possible to  genuinely flood a server with 
requests at a DoS repeat rate if you aren't careful. An example of how to deal with polling politely can be found in this
