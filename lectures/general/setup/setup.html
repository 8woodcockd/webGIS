Setting up your own server involves several steps:

<H3>Setting up a machine.</H3>
<P>
Your simplest option by far is to get a PC and install <A href="http://live.osgeo.org/">OSGeo-Live</A>, which comes with all the servers set up and 
configured for serving geographical data. Another, cheaper, option is to <A href="http://readwrite.com/2014/06/27/raspberry-pi-web-server-website-hosting">set up a Raspberry Pi as a webserver</A>, 
but you'd have to then install the various bits of software yourself (it's not that hard though).

<H3>Getting an IP address</H3>
<P>
While Universities etc. got in early and allocated themselves fixed <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</A>, most users on the net don't have a 
fixed IP address. Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) farm out an IP address to your home from their bank of addresses: a 
so-called <A href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/dynamic-static">dynamic IP address</A>. However, most servers need a fixed IP address so people can find them 
time after time through <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</A> lookups. To fix this problem, you have two 
choices: you can either get your ISP to give you a static address, or you can buy a forwarding service. Some ISPs, especially those offering TV services etc. 
may already have given you a static IP address: Virgin, for example, <A href="http://forums.thinkbroadband.com/virgin_cable/4369047-virgin-media-dynamic-ip-really-are-static.html">seem to dynamically allocate IPs, but on the basis of hardware</a> (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC</A>) addresses, so by most accounts they don't change unless you 
change router. Equally, some ISPs will sell you a static IP address (<A href="http://www.plus.net/support/broadband/products/IP_addresses_broadband.shtml">PlusNet</A>, for example). Either way, you should check your terms and conditions, as some ISPs limit what static IP Addresses can be used for (for instance, to prevent them being used for email spam). If your ISP doesn't offer a static address, then you can set up <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS#DDNS_for_Internet_access_devices">Dynamic DNS</A> on your router. DDNS works by your router sending its dyanmically allocated IP Address regularly to a third party who do have a static IP address and who allocate the address to you. They then forward 
any requests coming to the IP address to you at your latest IP Address. A popular service like this is <A href="http://www.noip.com/">NoIP</A>. Most DDNS companies will also offer Domain Name buying options.

Once you have a static IP address or DDNS, it is important to realise that this will be for your router (and you should *always* connect through a router, as they 
have extra firewall options). A specific machine within your internal network may still be allocated a <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">subnet address</A> dynamically. This will 
usually be something line <CODE>192.168.1.X</CODE> where <CODE>X</CODE> is some number allocated based on which machines booted first. If this is the case 
(and you can set up routers to issue individual static subnet addresses), you'll need to tell your Linux box to grab a fixed address. You 
can find instructions for doing this on <A href="http://www.wikihow.com/Assign-an-IP-Address-on-a-Linux-Computer">WikiHow</A> or 
<A href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-configure-a-static-ip-address-tutorial/">NixCraft</A> (also, for 
Windows on <A href="http://kb.linksys.com/Linksys/GetArticle.aspx?docid=7e4956723e074191bdf33777314ddfd8_3998.xml&">Linksys</A> and 
<A href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd163570.aspx">Microsoft</A>). You'll also need to check how to configure your router so it doesn't allocate it 
when the machine is off.
