<H2><A href="https://github.com/">GitHub</A>: Map from Data + Build a basic site</H2>
<P>
GitHub is probably the most flexible site for building free webpages that include some web-based mapping. GitHub offer free 
webspace through their <A href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</A> initiative. You can find more info 
on mapping on GitHub at <A href="http://robinlovelace.net/maps/2013/11/16/mapping-for-the-masses.html">Robin's blog</A>. You can find out more 
about uploading to GitHub in the <A href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/other/programming/practicals/advanced/part10/index.html">tutorial</A> which is part of Advanced Programming. Many people use <A href="">Jekyll</A> to manage their GitHub pages, as it integrates automatically. You can find out more 
details on the <A href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">Jekyll website</A> and <A href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">GitHub</A>

Amazon offer <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_%28cloud_computing%29">Elastic</A> 
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</A> where you can essentially get hold of either a real or virtual computer of 
various specs, with adminsitrative control. Although there is a charging model you want to keep a strong eye on, 
for web servers there are options which are <A href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free with certain data/hit limits</A> for 12 months.
