<h1> Developing Google Maps</h1>
<h2>Adding markers in</h2>

<p>So, we have now started to improve the layout a little bit. However, the map is still fundamentally the same. The next
thing we will do is to add some markers.  This should be relatively
straightforward as I've already got you to do this in Unit 2.  However, we'll go into a little more detail here.
<p>
To create a Marker, we use the <code>google.maps.Marker</code>.  An example of this is given below:
<p>
<div class="code_example">
<pre>...
  var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
      position: latlng, 
      map: map, 
      title:"Hello World!"
  });  
 ...</pre>
</div>

<p>The process for adding a marker is fairly simple: we create a new instance
of the <code>Marker()</code> object, and supply various properties: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>position</code> - where the marker is to be located</li>
  <li><code>map</code> - the name of the map object on which to place the new
    marker </li>
  <li><code>title</code> - a title that will be seen when we move the mouse
    over the marker</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties are supplied using the JSON '{key: value}' object notation:
the Marker() method takes one parameter, but that parameter is an object with
multiple properties.</p>

<p>In this example, we've used the same <code>latlng</code> that was created to
centre the map, and used as one of the parameters of
<code>google.maps.Map()</code>. If we wanted to use a different location, we
could create an additional lat-lng object, and use that instead. The second
property is the potentially confusing '<code>map: map</code>'. The first term
here - '<code>map:</code>' - indicates the property (of the
<code>Marker()</code> object) that we are setting. Its parameter (the second
'<code>map</code>') refers to the name of the google.maps.Map() object that we
created in the line '<code>var map = new
google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map_canvas"),myOptions);</code>'. Note
that the text supplied for the <code>title</code> property is a string object,
and must be placed in quotes.</p>

<h3>Task</H3>
Without looking at the code for the marker we created in the first
tutorial, can you put the above code in the correct place in your html
file?  Now
assume that you wish to add a second marker. How would you do this?  <p>
<br><b>Before you begin, save a copy of your work!</b>


<p>Creating a single marker (which so far, will not do anything useful, other
than display itself on the map) is of limited value - what we need to do is to
be able to attach some information to the marker, and then look towards
creating multiple markers, each with information attached.<p> However, before we
do that it would be useful to re-consider the code of the example.  It is
growing in length, and now would be a good time to restore some order!<br>
