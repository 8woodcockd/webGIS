<h2>Processing the data</h2>
<p>
There are a number of immediate issues to consider with the data.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Format</b> - it is currently in an Excel spread sheet - you will need to convert it to a Javascript array, defined in the same way as you did in the map_data.js file
<li><b>Incompleteness</b> - some records do not have an easting and northing - what are you going to do with these?
<li><b>Contents</b> - do you need all of the fields in your application?
<li><b>Georeference</b> - the records have a detailed grid reference - however, what we want is a WGS84 latitude / longitude pair of co-ordinates
</ul>

<p>

	The most significant of these problems are the first and last
ones. Changing the format of data can encompass both the on-disk
format (e.g. the file type) and the structure - the way that the data
are laid out. In general, the process of converting from an address
to a precise georeference is known as geocoding. We already have a
georeference for our data - the OS National Grid easting and northing
- but this is not yet in the correct format that we want to use. 
<p>
The
'formatting' box linked below describes the (quite painful) process
of editing data such into a usable form (or at least, into the JSON
Javascript array format that we wish to use, which is quite easy to
read by eye). A version of the data is available that has already had
most of the processing applied to it can be downloaded <a href="blueplaques_data_processed.js"> HERE.</a>
<p>

	You are free to use this version. Note however, that this data
file will still need some work - it contains some incomplete entries
(for example, with missing co-ordinates), that you will need to find
and decide what to do with those. That said, it may be useful to read the
format section in order to understand the lengthy process that was
followed to get the data into the required form. As stated
previously, it is a common occurrence to have some data that you wish
to map, but that have a structure that it not very close to the
structure that you require.
