<h1> Developing Google Maps</h1>

<h2>Continuing with the Leeds example</h2>

<p>First of all, we shall look at various ways of adding to and improving the
example that we developed in <a href="../module2.html"> Module 2</a> - it should resemble this:
<p>
<img src="endmod2.png" alt="Text" style = "width:580px;height:500px">
 <p>

There are a number
of ways the presentation can be improved. Firstly, it would be useful to make
the map bigger. The following code builds on Google_eg2.html and includes a few
modifications.<br>
<br>
</p>
<img src="google_eg3.png" alt="Text" style = "width:800px;height:500px">
<p>
The above code can be downloaded <a href="google_eg3.html"> here</a>.

<p>Two of these changes are solely to do with the presentation of the map on
the page. At the top, in the document header section, is a simple embedded
style sheet, which contains a single style instruction. The style instruction
dictates how an entity of the class 'gmap' should be rendered. In the body of
the document, the second change is that the &lt;div&gt; section containing our
map has been given the class 'gmap'; thus it will pick up the new rendering
instructions. This is an example of attaching both a CLASS and an ID to an
element. You should recall from the JavaScript tutorial that an ID is a unique
identifier for an elment (allowing it to be unamibguously referenced using
<code>document.getElementById()</code> ); the same CLASS on the other hand can
be attached to multiple elements (thus allowing you to change the presentation
of all those elements by editing only the CSS information for that class).</p>

<p>The use of style sheets offers many advantages and is recommended; they are
used in the examples in this module, although as with HTML coding, this module
cannot include a lengthy tutorial on their use. &nbsp;There are many guides to using
HTML and CSS on the web; a few starting points are given below: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Css/default.asp">CSS tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/">HTML / CSS reference</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The gmap class is fairly simple: a margin is defined, and a border is to be
placed around the object. The final part of the gmap class style is 'float:
right'; this causes the object to be drawn at the right of the screen, and for
text to flow around it.</p>

<p>The final modification is that the width and height
values for the <code>map_canvas</code> DIV have been made larger. Note that
there is no direct instruction (i.e. as part of the Javascript) to the Google
Maps API about how large the map should be. How does it know to return a
larger map? The answer is in the object initialisation function <code>new
google.maps.Map()</code>. This function has the parameter <p>
'<code>document.getElementById("map_canvas")</code>'
<p>

In other words it looks
through the code of the whole HTML document to find an element that has the id
'<code>map_canvas</code>' - the element it finds is of course our map
DIV. Having identified this element, the Map() object is able to check the
required size itself.<br>
</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>
Update your example to change the size of the map. Try different sizes, and if
you are familiar with CSS, try different style settings. Add some further text
to your example page.<br>
