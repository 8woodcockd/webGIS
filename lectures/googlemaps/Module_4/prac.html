<h2>Practical</h2>

This weeks practical involves taking a data file and generating a set of
markers from the data.<br>

<br>

The data are a list of blue plaques identifying buildings of historical
interest (or buildings with assocaitions with persons of historical interest)
in Leeds; these were recently catalogued as part of a book about Leeds. The
data contain the location of each plaque, details of who unveiled it and when,
and the text of the plaque. The data file is incomplete and will need some
editing before you start to use it.<br>
<br>
Your practical task is to create a map that contains markers for plaques for
which a grid-reference exists, and for each marker to have a pop-up window that
contains information about that plaque. You should also add suitable text to
the web pages that you create (in addition to the map object) that describe the
background to the data.<br>
<br>
The practical notes will contain details of how to convert from OS National
Grid co-ordinates to WGS84 Latitude / Longitude.<br>
