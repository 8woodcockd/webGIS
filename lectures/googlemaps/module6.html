<h1>Unit 6</h1>

<h2>Odds and ends</h2>

This unit contains some random bits and pieces that I'll keep adding to.  These are things that we haven't covered in detail in the course, but maybe useful.  If anyone has any extra time and wants to put a page together on something not covered, e.g. linking to Flickr, toggling layers etc - let me know!
