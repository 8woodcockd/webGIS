title: Creating your First Google Map Mash-Up

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Creating your First Google Map Mash-Up</h2>
<p>

Okay, so now you can access your personal webspace and have made a very basic page.  It's time to create a page with Google Maps!
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy the following text <a href="google_eg1.txt">(also here)</a> into a new file and save as <b>google_eg1.html</b>
<p>
<img src="google01.png" alt="Text" style = "width:680px;height:450px">
<p>


<li>Save the pasted text as <b>google_eg1.html</b> in your local directory, and then copy it to your WWW/GEOG5870 directory using WinSCP (if off campus). 
<li>Now try browsing to this file (i.e. www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~username/geog5870/google_eg1.html)
<li>It is important to make sure that the '~' character in the URL used remains as such, and is not modified by your browser - you may need to change it back in the url entry box if necessary.
</ol>

And if the Google Map gods are feeling kind, you should end up with this:
<p>
<img src="FirstMap.png" alt="Text" style = "width:800px;height:450px">
<p>
You will discover that this map, although presented in a basic manner, can be panned using the mouse like other Google Maps.

<h2>Organising your webspace</h2>

<p>Before we start making some adjustments to this map, make sure that you <b>save</b> each version of your map under a different name so you can refer back to the working code when something breaks! 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the file index.html that you created earlier
<li>Add a link to the new file google_eg1.html
</ul>
One way of presenting links is as a bulleted list, thus you could create a link like this (making sure that the file that you are pointing to is in the same directory as index.html):
<p>

<img src="bulletlist.png" alt="Text" style = "width:500px;height:75px">
<p>
You can now publish web pages on the ISS personal server (or on your own server), and show off your maps.
<p>
Give it a go before getting stuck into the tasks below.

<h2>Tasks: Adjusting the map</h2>
<p>
Now you have your first map, let's do something with it.  
<ul>
<li><b>Default location:</b>Let's change the default location.  To do this, find the following lines of code:
<p>
<code>var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(-34.397, 150.644); </code>
<p>
Notice the latitude and longitude values.  This determines the default
centre location of your map.  These are the numbers that we will change.
To do this, go to <a href="http://www.latlong.net/">LatLong.net</a> and
input a location of your choosing.  Enter these values into the code,
save the code.  Hit refresh - what do you see?  Hopefully your map
should now be centred on your chosen location.
<p>
<li><b>Zoom:</b> Find the line that sets the zoom level.  It should be set at "8". 
Change this number to a value between 0 and 20.  Save and refresh.  What
number is the most zoomed in?  What is the most zoomed out?
<p>
<li><b>Changing the base map</b>: Find the line that sets the base map:
<p>
<code>mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP</code>
<p>
You can change the MapTypeId from ROADMAP to other values.  Here are the valid map types:
<ul>
<li>ROADMAP displays the normal, default 2D tiles of Google Maps.
<li>SATELLITE displays photographic tiles.
<li>HYBRID displays a mix of photographic tiles and a tile layer for prominent features (roads, city names).
<li>TERRAIN displays physical relief tiles for displaying elevation and water features (mountains, rivers, etc.).
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Adding a point marker:</b> The following code <a href ="google_eg2.txt">(also here)</a> produces a marker
icon on the center of your map.  REPLACE the LatLng values with the
latitude longitude coordinates you used for the center of your map.
<p>
<img src="marker.png" alt="Text" style = "width:580px;height:300px">
<p>
It's important that this text is placed within the
<code>initialize()</code> function.  Move it outside the function to see
what happens!  Save your file and refresh.  Hopefully, you should see a
Marker at the centre for your map.
<p>
<li><b>Info Window</b>: Now we will attach an info box to the marker we
have just created.  This will appear when you click on it. Immediately
after the code for adding a marker in, insert the following <a
href="google_eg3.txt"> (also here) </a>:
<p>
<img src="infobox.png" alt="Text" style = "width:500px;height:140px">
<p>

</ul>
<p>
You have now created your very own first mash-up!  See - there's nothing to this Google Maps malarky...
