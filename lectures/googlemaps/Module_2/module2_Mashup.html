<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Google Mash-ups</h2>

<p>One of the most important features of Google Maps, from the point of view of
web-based GIS, is that users are able to plot their own data (or data taken
from a remote third party) on top of a base map provided by Google. The use of
Google Maps as a base map on which to plot further data quickly became referred
to as a 'map mashup' (the phrase is lifted from pop music). A generic characteristic of a mashup is that the map
application appears on the web page of a third party, without any apparent
direct input by Google. That is, a novice user who did not immediately
recognize the layout, drawing styles and iconography of a Google Map would not
be aware that the map was using Google Maps as it's base.</p>

<h3>Early mashups</h3>

HousingMaps: Properties for sale in Los Angeles (Image taken Feb 2009).

<p>The first such mashup to have been produced using Google Maps is generally
identified as <a href="http://www.housingmaps.com/">www.housingmaps.com</a>.
HousingMaps integrates two data sources: base data taken from
Google Maps, and information on properties for sale or rent taken from <a href="www.craigslist.org">craigslist</a>, a popular site that allows free
placing of classified ads. The interface is simple: a map occupies most of the
screen, and there are some simple filters that allow users to select by city
and by price bracket.</p>

<p>The site is typical of simple mashups. A number of markers are drawn on the
base map, and these link to data taken from the third party source. When
markers are defined in a Google Map, they require location information, but
also allow further data to be associated with them (typically text and
graphics). Thus, by clicking on one of the markers, a popup window shows images
and gives details of the indvidual property.<br>

Using the <a href="www.archive.org">wayback machine</a>, look for previous
versions of the housingmaps home page.<br>
<br>
When was the first version recorded? How much time had elapsed between Google
Maps becoming available, and this mash up being made available? </div>
<p>
The site usually identified as being the second mashup produced is <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">www.chicagocrime.org</a>. ChicagoCrime uses
reported crime data, as collated by the Chicago police department, and maps the
locations at which these crimes have been reported. The figure below shows reported
cases of aggravated arson. The site integrates a rather more complex and varied
data source than the property data in the HousingMaps example, and the site
contains multiple pages to drive the mashup application.<p>

These early examples are pretty simple by today's standards.  Here's a more recent one that I like from <a href="http://weatherspark.com/#"> Weather Spark </a>.  You can even look up the weather on the day you were born!
