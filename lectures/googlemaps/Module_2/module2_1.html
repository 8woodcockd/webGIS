title: Setting up your webspace 
---


<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Setting up your webspace </h2>

<p>Over the course of this block of Web-GIS, we will gradually build up
a sophisticated map using features of the Google Maps API.  There is a
major prerequisite to doing this, which is that it is necessary to have
access to a web server on which you can publish web pages. It is also
helpful to have a good editor, such as notepad++ for working with HTML
files, although this is often a matter of personal preference.
<p>
The sole purpose of this tutorial is to get you to access your personal webspace both on and off campus.
<p>
All students (and members of staff etc.) at Leeds University are able to
create and publish their own pages, using the server
<b> www.personal.leeds.ac.uk</b> For full details of how to do this, see: 
<br>
<a href = "http://it.leeds.ac.uk/info/77/managing_your_account/473/how_to_create_a_personal_homepage"> ISS: How to create a personal homepage </a>
<p>
Note that you must <b>read the guidelines</b> for web page creation,
which describe various contents that you must <b>not</b> include in a
personal web page published by the university. The following instructions
should work to enable you to access your personal space both on and off campus.  

<h2>Accessing your webspace from the University Campus</h2>
<p>
If you are working from a computer on campus, accessing your personal webspace is very straightforward.

<ul>
<li>Open up your File Directory and navigate to your M: drive.  
<li>	Create a directory 'WWW' (note it must be in capital letters!).
<li>	Under your WWW directory, create a directory called geog5870.
(Note that this course is taught face-to-face under the module code
GEOG5870.  The ODL version is GEOG5871. My examples use both codes, so make sure you use the right one and are consistent!) 
<li>	Within the GEOG5870 directory, create an html file called <b>index.html</b>; this file
does not need to contain much at the moment - just a note saying that
you will be using this directory for the module exercises. 
<li>	Check that you can access the pages as:
<b> www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~your_username/geog5870 </b> 
<li>	Do not forget to include the ~ (tilde) before your username!
</ul>

<h2>Accessing your webspace OFF the University Campus</h2>
<p>
To access your personal webspace off campus we need to FTP into your
account.  FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol.  Simply, it is a secure
method of transferring files between computers. To FTP we are going to use a program called WinSCP.  This has a graphical interface that makes transferring files very easy.  

<p>

<br> Download the program from the <a href = "http://winscp.net/eng/download.php"> WinSCP download site</a> 
<p>
Under host name enter <b>ftps.home.leeds.ac.uk</b> and then put your ISS
username and passwords in (these are the passwords that you access the
VLE with).  Under protocol
select <b>FTP</b> and <b>SSL Explicit encryption</b>.  Hit Login.
<p>

<p>
Hit yes to any dialog box that comes up.  You then have before you the
WinSCP directories with your home drive on the left and this time your
personal space on the right.

<p>

Login to your personal space using WinSCP as outlined above. <ul>
<li>	Create a directory 'WWW' (note it must be in capital letters!).
<li>	Under your WWW directory, create a directory called geog5870.
(Note that this course is taught face-to-face under the module code
GEOG5870.  The ODL version is GEOG5871. My examples use both codes, so make sure you use the right one and are consistent!)
<li>	Within the GEOG5870 directory, create an html file called <b>index.html</b>; this file
does not need to contain much at the moment - just a note saying that
you will be using this directory for the module exercises. 
<li>	Check that you can access the pages as:
<b> www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~your_username/geog5870 </b> 
<li>	Do not forget to include the ~ (tilde) before your username!
</ul>
