<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>The Google Maps API</h2>
<p>
In the example using KML files, there was no need to use a Google Maps
API key. It's possible to produce useful maps through this method.
Rather than typing the KML url into the query box each time, it's also
possible to create a fixed url that can be clicked on.  It is therefore possible to create an application that dynamically draws
a map based on some criteria. The process would be roughly as follows:
<ul>
<li>A data source is selected (possibly under user direction and with
selected filtering)
<li>A server-side script retrieves that data,
processes and filters it as required
<li>If necessary, a geo-coding
routine is used to create suitable co-ordinates for each data point
<li>The script then writes a new kml file, containing correctly
formatted details and co-ordinates for each data point
<li>Finally, the
script writes a web page which is sent to the user, which contains a
suitably generated link to maps.google.com that contains a reference to
the bespoke KML file. 
<p>

This process would allow sets of markers to be
dynamically created, but would not offer any further control over the
presentation of the map, and furthermore, the newly generated link would
cause the user to navigate away from the original web site.
<p>
Much more control is possible if we use the Google Maps API.  We will now
revisit this example, and see how it can be improved.

<h3>Improving the look</h3>


Firstly, the general layout of the web page can be improved, as the
original contains the map and nothing else. Secondly, we'll re-centre
the map, so that it is focused on Leeds. The following figure shows a revised
version of the first Google Maps example (google_eg1.html).
<p>

<img src="prac1.png" alt="Text" style = "width:580px;height:400px">
<p>

There are a number of changes to the original file. Firstly, the STYLE
and META tags in the HEAD section have been removed, as we do not want
the map to occupy the whole of the window, and also to make the file
simpler. Other changes to the original file are highlighted: 
<ul>
<li>The co-ordinates using when creating the latlng variables have been
changed, to use latitude and longitude for the School of Geography.
These are the same co-ordinates that were used in the KML file example,
but there is an important difference: in this case, we quote latitude
first, whereas in the KML file, we gave the longitude first! 
<li>Two
lines of HTML have been added to the body section of the document,
containing links to your homepage under www.personal.leeds.ac.uk (or at
least, to a relative location that should be the homepage), and to the
index document in the current directory - which should be the geog5870
directory. These links will only work properly if the target files
exist. </ul>
<p>
For your final task, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Create a copy of google_eg1.html, called google_eg2.html
<li>Make the changes described above (or similar changes if you wish
to add more HTML, or have a different set of starting co-ordinates).  The code for the above example can be found <a href="Prac1.html"> here</a>.
<li>Make sure that you have a copy in the WWW/geog5870 directory
<li>Create a link in your index file to the new file google_eg2.html
<li>Load the new page in your browser and make sure that it works as
expected. 
</ul>
<p>
You should now have a modified example that is focused on
Leeds. The map can be panned and zoomed; some controls are included on
the map, and it should also respond to double-click events, and to mouse
wheel events. The size and type of controls that are included by default
depend on the map size. In the above example, the map is relatively
small. Try increasing the height and width parameters (in the style
parameter of the map_canvas DIV), and you will see that as the map
becomes larger so that map controls become more detailed. 

<h2>API Summary</h2> 
On
this page you have taken the basic example supplied by Google Maps,
changed the location and added some controls. This has involved a number
of function calls to the Google Maps API. Full documentation for the API
is available on line from Google.<p>

<p> Now you have some familiarity, you can move onto <a href="../module3.html">Module 3</a> that will
introduce Java Script (the code behind Google Maps) in more detail.
