<h1>Google Maps: An Introduction</h1>

<p>
<h2>Street view</h2>

<p>
The 'street' view is a set of panoramic photographs taken at
various locations.  The viewer can explore these interactively
with pan and zoom facilities, and also the ability to move to another
camera location. The images were mostly captured from cars
specially adapted for the purpose with panoramic cameras mounted on a
pole on the roof of the vehicle. The Street View photos can be
accessed where available either a dragging a person icon on the visible
map, or by zooming in beyond the usual maximum.  When it
was
introduced, Street view was available only in limited
locations
in the US; the availability of data has subsequently increased to
include many US cities, and a growing number of cities in Japan,
Australasia and Europe. <br>
</p>
<p>The following figure
shows a street view image from New York
City; the Flatiron Building can be seen in the image. This
image also illustrates a feature of the default Map view that is
present in maps of New York: isometric outlines of buildings are
included as a topographic feature.  Playing around with this view, the image can be tilted to get a 3D view and transit routes, such as bike routes, displayed.

The next figure shows the extent of
Street view imagery available in Paris as of October 2014.</p>
<p>In addition to those images that were captured by road-going cars, some
notable sites have also been captured using tricycle mounted cameras,
which are able to move along public footpaths etc. <p>

<p>The Street View images have been the subject of controversy since they
were introduced, with critics arguing that they represent an invasion
of privacy, and also that they could be used for reconnaissance purposes
by criminals.</p>
<p>Street View imagery of the UK was
introduced in March 2009. It is therefore worth spending some time
considering the scope of Street View in the UK. The following figure shows a
typical Street View image, taken outside Leeds University. Coverage extends to all public streets in the area. The School of
Geography can only be seen at a distance, as it is located on a road
privately owned by the university. The image shown here - of the main entrance to the University - was taken
in the middle of the day; images in busier locations including tourist
oriented ones often seem to have been taken very early in the morning
to avoid crowding.</p>

<p>The initial release of Street View in the UK covered 25 areas,
although it has since been considerably expanded. These were mostly the
largest urban areas, but there were some
exceptions. The most heavily populated locations <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> featured in the original data release include Brighton, Portsmouth, Bournemouth and
Reading. Within each city that was featured, the extent of coverage
varies. The areas covered were home to perhaps 25% of the population of
the
UK, although given the urban focus, the areas are not necessarily
representative of all types of area within the UK.</p>
<p>The introduction of Street View imagery in the UK was greeted with a
mixed response. The launch merited widespread coverage in
newspapers and other media, with a number of critics complaining that
the images respresented an invasion of privacy. The campaign
group <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/">Privacy
International</a> formally raised complaints with the Office of the
Information Commissioner, citing a number of instances of possible
invasion of privacy, including these cases:<br>
</p>


<div class="quote">
<ul><li>A fifteen year-old boy was caught on Street View carrying a
skateboard, which his parents had expressly forbade him from using. The
boy subsequently had a row with the parents and is now staying with
friends.</li><li>A married man was captured speaking at close proximity with a
female colleague. Because of nearby noisy road works he was forced to
speak into her ear, but the image created the appearance of intimacy.
This image created a tense argument between the married couple.</li><li>A woman who has for several years been moving house to avoid
detection from a former violent partner complained to us that she felt
extreme distress when Street View identified her outside her new home.</li></ul>
Source: Privacy International (2009) Open letter: PI files complaint
about Google Street View, 23/03/2009.

<p>Google contended that a number of steps had been taken to avoid
invasion of privacy, and that these steps had been discussed with the
Information Commissioner prior to launching the service.</p>
<p>The primary method used is the application of an algorithm that blurs
faces.&nbsp; It is notable that the algorithm is applied automatically,
and thus also blurs images of faces, for example in advertising
hoardings. However, this algorithm is not 100% consistent.</p>


<p>The last two figures here show two different views of a republican mural in Belfast
as seen in Google Street View. The first image was
captured from the Falls Road; the face depicted in the mural (that of
the MP Bobby Sands, who died following a hunger strike in 1981) has been
blurred. The second image was captured at closer range, and
has not been blurred, presumably because the image is too large to be
recognised as a face.</p>

<h2> Traffic </h2>

<p>A final mode, available only in selected locations is
the 'traffic mode', in which roads are highlighted according to the
current degree of congestion. As with the Terrain view, this was
offered as a distinct view when launched, but has now been relegated to
layer status. The figure below shows traffic
congestion
in part of San Francisco. The traffic congestion information
is gathered in near real-time. As with other mapping
features,
the traffic mode was introduced for a limited number of American cities
before being rolled out to other locations. The extent to which traffic
information is available depends on locally available data, and thus
the types of roads which are monitored vary.</p>

<p>A
relatively
recent adaptation of 'traffic mode' is the ability to select either
live information, or the mean previously recorded information.
The following figures show the traffic congestion information displayed
for
Leeds both (a) live (a Tuesday early afternoon)
and (b) the average conditions for a Friday evening.<br>

<h2>Task</h2>
<br>Select an area in the UK with which you are familiar and
examine how it
appears in different Google Maps view.  Next, select an area
in a major US city, and look at the different map views available.<br>
<br>Consider
- preferably in pairs - a variety of tasks that you may undertake, such
as finding the location of a particular shop or planning a journey.
Which map modes are mosty useful? Take a few
minutes and
try to find an example for each of the modes - including the US only
ones of a use for which that
mode would be the most useful. <br>
<p>

<p>Like
all maps, the correctness of the data that is made available is of
great importance. In the next section, we will consider
issues
relating to the correctness of map data.<br>
