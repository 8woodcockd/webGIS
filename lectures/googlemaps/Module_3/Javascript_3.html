<h2>Program statements</h2>
<p>The <a href="Javascript_2.html"> previous page </a>introduced various language elements and
described the way in which code should be written. It mostly focussed
on <span style="font-style: italic;">expressions</span> - small fragments of code (such as 'x &lt; y', or 'a == 1')<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
that can be evaluated to produce a result; the result typically being
'true' or 'false'. Some of the examples showed expressions in the
context of a larger program, but in general we have not considered how
we actually make the program <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> something. In order to get the program to carry out some action, we need to use <span style="font-style: italic;">statements</span>, and this page introduces some basic statements. All programs consist of a series of statements that are carried out in order.</p>
<h3>Simple and compound statements<br>
</h3>
<p>We have already seen some statements in the examples shown so far.
Figure 1 showed a very simple program that consisted of one line of
JavaScript, embedded within an HTML page; that JavaScript program
consisted of the single statement 'alert()', with a text string
containing a message included as a parameter to the statement. In this
case, 'alert()' is a function statement: we are causing the program to
carry out a (pre-defined) function. Other single-line statements
include variable declaration statements using 'var' as we saw on the
previous page.</p>
<p>On other occasions we need to carry more complicated actions that
can be expressed in a single statement, and for these we need to use <span style="font-style: italic;">compound statements</span>.
Compound statements are treated within the wider structure of the
program as a single statement, but they consist internally of a number
of sub-statements.&nbsp; The sub-statements are grouped together within
curly brackets '{ }'. We've already seen this in some of the examples
shown so far, but it is illustrated below in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows
the generic structure of an 'if' statement. If a certain condition is
met (the supplied expression is evaluated and the result is 'true')
then the following statement is carried out; if the result of the
expression is 'false', then the statement is ignored, and we continue
on to the next statement in the program.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; alert("x is positive");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; positive_values++; // update a counter<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
<br>
 </div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 6: Use of simple and compound statements</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<p>Figure 6b shows an example using a single statement. Note that as
described on the previous page, the layout is flexible.&nbsp; Here, the
sub-statement which depends on the if statement is shown indented on
the next line, but it could be continued on the same line if preferred.
The sub-statement ends in a semi-colon, as all statements usually
should. In this example, if the condition is met, then the alert()
function is called. But what happens if we want a series of actions to
occur? How can we distinguish between a series of actions to be carried
out if the if statement is true, and the next statements that will be
used if the if statement is not true? The answer, is that we use a
compound statement. Figure 6c shows a compound statement with two
sub-statements. These are grouped together using '{ }', and this block
is treated as a single statement in the overall structure. The example
in Figure 6c thus still fits the generic template of Figure 6a. The
compound statement consists of two sub-statements, and both of these
are terminated with a semi-colon as usual. If the if statement is
false, then the entire compound statement is ignored.<br>
</p>
<p>The example in Figure 6 illustrated a single case of a uncomplicated
compound statement. In practice compound statements may consist of many
sub-statements. It is also important to note that compound statements
can be nested: one of the sub-statements in a compound statement may
itself be a compound statement, and so on...</p>
<h3>Control statements</h3>
<p>The first set of statements we shall consider are control statements.
 Control statements regulate the flow and branching of the program, and 
thus allow complex behaviours to be programmed. We have already met the 
most fundamental of control statements - the 'if' statement.</p>
<h4>if, else, else if</h4>
<p>Figure 6 illustrated the basic form of the <code>if</code> statement. This can be expanded using the optional <code>else</code> clause, as shown in Figure 7.
Using the basic form shown in Figure 6, an expression is evaluated and
then a statement is carried out if the expression is true. If it is not
true, we move on to the next statement. We also move on to that next
statement after carrying out our sub-statement if the expression was
found to be true: thus, the next statement will always be used. But,
what happens if we want to specify one behaviour if the expression is
true, and an alternative behaviour if the expression is not true? For
that, we can use the <code>if .. else</code> form of the statement.
Figure 7a shows the generic form of the if statement using the else
clause, and Figure 7b shows a simple example. In this example, we
display one message if x is greater than 0, and another message if not.
But wait a moment, you say, that second statement isn't quite right!
What if x is zero? A common use of the else clause is to follow it with
another if statement. An example is shown in Figure 7c. Note that 'else
if' isn't a special form of the if statement in it's own right, we are
simply following a standard 'else' clause with a new 'if' statement.<br>

&nbsp; alert("x is negative");<br>
else<br>

&nbsp; alert("x is zero");<br>

<br>

<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 7: Using if...else</span><br>
<p>The final part of the example in Figure 7c uses an 'else' clause
followed by a statement other than 'if'. It is always good practice to
finish an if...else sequence in this way: the final option will always
by used if no other conditions have been met.<br>
 </p>
<h4>switch</h4>
<p>The if...else form of the if statement allows you to build up
programs which can branch in multiple ways depending on the results of
various expressions. In the example in Figure 7, we used a sequence of
tests against the variable 'x', and it is easy to imagine situations in
which many more than two options (plus a catch-all) might be
considered. Whilst 'if...else' can be used for these situations,
JavaScript offers a more efficient structure for testing multiple
values of a single variable: the <code>switch</code> statement. The switch statement is divided up into a set of alternative actions, using the <code>case</code> keyword. This is illustrated in Figure 8.</p>
<div class="code_example">switch(x) {<br>
<br>
case 0:<br>
&nbsp; // Do something if x=0<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; ...statements...</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
&nbsp; break;<br>
<br>
case 1:<br>

&nbsp; // Do something if x=1<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; ...statements...</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

&nbsp; break;<br>

<br>
case 2:<br>

&nbsp; // Do something if x=2<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; ...statements...</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

&nbsp; break;<br>

<br>
default:<br>

&nbsp; // Do something if the previous cases were not matched<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; ...statements...</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

&nbsp; break;<br>

<br>
}<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 8: A switch statement</span><br>
<p>Note that all of the <span style="font-style: italic;">case</span> options are followed be a series of statements which are terminated with the <span style="font-style: italic;">break</span>
keyword, which causes program execution to move beyond the outer switch
statement. A switch statement should include a series of case options,
plus a final catch-all state, identified using the special keyword
'default'. The whole body of the switch statement is written as a
compound statement, and thus placed within '{ }'.</p>
<h4>while and for loops<br>
</h4>
<p>The control statements if and switch allow alternative branches of a 
program to be executed in different circumstances. An alternative set of
 control statements allow various parts of the code to be repeated a 
number of times. These are known as <span style="font-style: italic;">loops</span>, and they make writing programs far easier and more efficient. The first of these statements is <code>while</code>
statement, which is illustrated in Figure 9. Figure 9a shows the
generic form of the statement, whilst Figure 9b shows an example.<br>
</p>


 
<div class="code_example"><span style="font-weight: bold;">a) Generic structure</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>while (expression)<br>

&nbsp; statement<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
b) A worked example</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>
x = 1;<br>while (x &lt; 10) {<br>
&nbsp; document.write(x);<br>
&nbsp; x++;<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
</div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 9: Using a while loop</span><br>

<p>The generic form is straightforward: whilst the given expression is true, then repeatedly carry out the statement.</p>
<p>Figure 9b shows how we might use this. First all we set up a counter variable <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>,
(which we assume has been properly declared earlier in the program),
and then start a while loop. We will carry out the statement forever
whilst x is less than ten. in this example, we are using a compound
statement with two sub-statements. In the first of these sub-statements,
we use the function document.write() to write the current value of x on
screen. (In this case, without any spacing or line breaks, so it would
look like this: 12345... etc). The function document.write() uses the
write() method of the pre-defined <span style="font-style: italic;">document</span> object. Back to our example: our next sub-statement is '<code>x++;</code>'. As described on the previous page, '++' is a special operator that increments a variable by one. It is referred to as a <span style="font-style: italic;">unary</span> operator, because it only requires one argument (variable).
This causes our counter variable to advance, and without it we would be
stuck inside the loop forever, as x would always be less than ten.
Loops which run forever are known as <span style="font-style: italic;">infinite loops</span>, and are a common form of bug.</p>
<p>The example shown if Figure 9b contains three important operations
on the counter or loop variable: it is initialised (x=1), it is tested
(x&lt;10) and it is incremented (x++). All of these stages are vital to
the loop running as expected. JavaScript offers an alternative
structure for loops that places these three operations in the same
place, with the intended result that it is harder to make a mistake and
forget one of the operations. The alternative structure is a <code>for</code> loop, and it is illustrated in Figure 10, using the same sequence of instructions as in Figure 9.<br>
</p>
<div class="code_example"><span style="font-weight: bold;">a) Generic structure</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>for (initialisation; test; increment)<br>

&nbsp; statement<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
b) A worked example</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>for (x = 1; x &lt; 10; x++) {<br>
&nbsp; document.write(x);<br>&nbsp; }<br>
</div>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This page has introduced the idea of statements - parts of the
program that do something. We have concentrated on control structures,
which affect the branching and looping of a program, and used only a
couple of simple 'actions' to actually generate some form of output. In
the next pages, we shall explore more fully how JavaScript is embedded
in a web page, andshow some example of simple programs that actually do something worth doing <br>
