<h1>Basic JavaScript</h1>

<h2>Language elements<br>
</h2>

<p>By tradition, the first example program shown for computer languages
is one called 'Hello World', the purpose of which is simply to write
the message 'hello world' to some type of output. Figure 1 shows the
source of a simple web page which contains a JavaScript 'hello world'
program.<br></p>

<div class="code_example">&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;A simple web page&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>alert("Hello world!");<br>&lt;/script&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br><br>&lt;body&gt;<br>Page body text<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br><br>&lt;/html&gt;<br><br>

</div><span style="font-weight: bold;">


Figure 1: A JavaScript 'hello world' program</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</p>

A copy of the resulting program can be seen <a href="javascript_helloworld.html">here</a>.

<p>We'll consider later on the way in which this code is
embedded in the web page, and look first at the fundamentals of the
language. The 'hello world' program consists of the single line: <code>alert("Hello world!");</code>, all the rest of the Figure is the HTML page that contains that short program.</p>
<h3>Code layout and format<br>
</h3>
<h4>Case sensitivity</h4>
<p>JavaScript is a case sensitive language.&nbsp; Our 'hello world'
program used the function alert(); if we'd written it as 'ALERT()', or
'Alert()', the program would not have worked, as the function would not
have been recognised.&nbsp; Similarly, when we come to use variables,
it is important to note that 'x' and 'X' are different variables.</p>
<h4>Whitespace</h4>
<p>JavaScript largely ignores extra whitespace (spaces, tabs, line
breaks), which means that you can format you code with whatever pattern
of spacing and indentation that you like.&nbsp; Clear spacing and
indentation can help to make the code more readable and make the
purpose clear, but it is a matter of personal preference.</p>
<h4>Line terminators</h4>
<p>All statements (roughly speaking, the same thing as 'a line of code') should be ended with the semicolon character '<code>;</code>', as in
our example above. As noted in the introduction, JavaScript was
designed to be forgiving, and one example of this is that line
terminators can be omitted; however it is considered sloppy practice to
do this, and it is possible to write ambiguous code if you rely on
JavaScript to 'do the right thing' when you leave line endings out.<br>
</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>

<p>All programs - whatever language they are written in - should
contains comments. Comments are messages to a human reader (although
sometimes you might include comments that are intended to be processed
by external program) that explain what is going on in the program.
JavaScript recognises a number of different comment styles. Single line
comments start with '<code>//</code>' - anything after that will be ignored. Longer multi-line comments can be placed between the opening characters '<code>/*</code>' and the closing characters '<code>*/</code>'. Examples of different comment styles are shown in Figure 2.<br>
</p>
<div class="code_example">// This is a single line comment<br>
<br>
i = 1; // Comments can also be placed after some code<br>
<br>
/* This is a <br>
multi-line<br>
comment */<br>
<br>
/*<br>
&nbsp;* People often<br>
&nbsp;* format<br>
&nbsp;* multi-line comments like this<br>
&nbsp;*/<br>
<br>
/* This comment uses multi-line format */<br>
</div>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 2: JavaScript comments</p>
<h4>Identifiers, literals and reserved words</h4>
<p>An <span style="font-style: italic;">identifier</span> is a name of a data item, such as a variable, array of function, whilst a <span style="font-style: italic;">literal</span> is a fixed value that is not going to change. In the second comment example in Figure 2, the sample code '<code>i = 1;</code>' contains an example of a variable (which has the identifier <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>)
and a literal value, 1. There are some simple rules that govern the
names that can be used for identifiers. The first character must be an
uppercase or lowercase letter, or a dollar sign ( $ ) or the underscore
character ( _ ). The remainder can be any mixture of letters, numbers,
dollar signs or underscore characters. A final restriction is that
identifiers cannot be one of the <span style="font-style: italic;">reserved words</span> in JavaScript. Reserved words are keywords that are used as commands and in-built functions,
clearly a program that used such terms as variable names would be very
confusing. Figure 3 lists current reserved words, including some that
have been specified in the Ecma standard as reserved for possible
future use in JavaScript. You do not need to memorise these lists, just
to be aware that reserved words exist, and that you should choose
variable names appropriately. If your code is behaving unexpectedly,
(or generally, failing to run), it may be worth checking that you have
not tried to use a reserved word as an identifier.</p>

<h3>Data types and values</h3>
<p>Having discussed the code format and layout, we can now look more
closely at what goes in to the program. The first area to look at is
data types - what sorts of variables and other data items we can use.
JavaScript supports a number of primitive types, plus more
sophisticated composite types. Primitive data types are numbers (with
no distinction between integers or floating point numbers), text
strings, and boolean values (that can have the value either 'true' or
'false'. Composite types include arrays - collections of primitive
types - and objects, which incorporate both data items and functions
that act on those data items. JavaScript includes a number of built in
specialised objects, including for example, objects representing the
browser window and the current document.</p>
<h4>Variable declaration</h4>
<p>New variables must be declared using the keyword 'var', for example: <code>var i;</code> or <code>var i = 1;</code>.&nbsp;
In the former case the variable has been created but is not yet
defined, in the latter case we have both declared it and <span style="font-style: italic;">initialised</span> it (given it a value). <br>
</p>
<h4>Numbers</h4>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Numbers</span> can be represented
in various forms in JavaScript - integers, floating point values and
octal (base 8) or hexadecimal (base 16) values. Basic operations occur
as you might expect, using +, -, * and /, for example '<code>i = i + 1;</code>' or '<code>x = y * z;</code>'.&nbsp; More advanced functions are available through the <span style="font-style: italic;">Math</span> object; for example '<code>x = Math.sqrt(y);</code>'. Here, we are calculating <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> as the square root of <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span>, using the <code>sqrt()</code> method of the <code>Math</code> object. We will learn more about objects and methods below.</p>
<h4>Strings</h4>
<p>A <span style="font-style: italic;">string</span> is a sequence of
characters - letters, digits, punctuation marks and so on. Strings must
be placed within quotes, using either single or double quote characters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>'This is a string'</li>
  <li>"So is this"</li>
  <li>"Don't forget that single quotes can be used inside double quotes"</li>
</ul>
<p>Strings can be joined using the '+' operator, for example: <code>mesg = 'Hello ' + 'world!';</code></p>
<h4>Boolean values</h4>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Boolean</span> data type has
only two possible values - true or false. You will most commonly come
across these implicitly (i.e. they won't be named variables) as the
result of logical comparisons. Consider the code fragment:</p>
<pre>if (x &gt; y)<br>  a = a + 1;<br>else<br>  b = b + 1;<br></pre>
<p>In the first line, we make a comparison between two values, <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span>,
and then specify two alternative things for the program to do depending
on their relative values. The comparison gives a result that is either
true or false; this is a Boolean value.<br>
</p>
<h4>Objects</h4>
<p>An <span style="font-style: italic;">object</span> is a composite data type that includes several named data items, that are usually referred to as <span style="font-style: italic;">properties</span> of the object.&nbsp; We can refer to the properties of an object using the syntax <span style="font-style: italic;">object_name.property_name</span>. Thus, if we had an object called point, we might refer to the properties <span style="font-style: italic;">point.x</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">point.y</span>. Objects also have <span style="font-style: italic;">methods</span>;
these are functions that act on properties of the object (or on data
passed in as a method parameter). We saw an example of this in the
description of numbers above; <code>sqrt()</code> is a method that is part of the <code>Math</code> object. Methods are access in the same manner as properties, using the syntax <span style="font-style: italic;">object_name.method_name</span>.</p>
<p>The properties of an object can be data items, functions (methods)
or other object types. The fact that an object property can itself be
an object means that you will see pieces of JavaScript code with
multiple full stops, like this: <br>
</p>
<pre>document.myform.button</pre>
<p>Here, we are referring to <code>button</code>, which is a property of the object <code>myform</code>, which in turn is a property of the object <code>document</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Objects are declared using a different manner to that used for primitive types. The <code>new</code> operator is used, like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>var i = new Object();</code></li>
  <li><code>var myDate = new Date();</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span> is being declared as a new generic object, to which we can attach properties and methods, whilst <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> is being declared as an instance of a the specialised built in object <code>Date</code>. Defined objects have special <span style="font-style: italic;">constructor functions</span>, which set up properties and methods, and typically set the initial values of various properties.<br>
</p>
<h4>Arrays</h4>
<p>A regular <span style="font-style: italic;">array</span> is a specialised object which contains a set of data values which can be referred to by <span style="font-style: italic;">index</span> values, starting at 0. This if we have an array <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>, then <span style="font-style: italic;">x[0]</span> refers to the first value in the array, <span style="font-style: italic;">x[1]</span> to the second value, and so on. As they are objects, arrays are also declared using the new operator:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>var myArray = new Array(); // declares an empty array</code></li>
  <li><code>var myOtherArray = new Array(3,5,7); // an array declared and initialised with three values</code></li>
  <li><code>var countries = new Array('England,'Scotland,'Wales'); // an array with text items</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can also declare arrays using a special array notation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>var myArray = []; // creates a new array</code></li>
  <li><code>var myOtherArray = [0,'x',true] // creates and initialises an array containing different data types.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Arrays can contain any data types, including other arrays, thus we can create matrices like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>var myMatrix = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ];</code><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we have created an array called <code>myMatrix</code>, using
the [] notation. It contains three elements, each of which is an array,
again declared using the array notation. We can refer to elements of
this matrix, for example <code>myMatrix[1][2]</code> refers to the third element (since we start counting at zero!) of the second value (the array [4,5,6]) in <code>myMatrix</code>.</p>
<p>Since arrays are specialised objects, they can have methods as well
as the value properties. The Array() object is a specially defined
object, that has a number of built in methods and properties, including
'<code>sort()</code>' and '<code>length</code>'. The property <code>length</code>
indicates how many elements the array has, and will change as more
elements are added to the array. The method sort, as you might expect,
sorts the array. (Something that is less obvious is that by default
'sort()' uses dictionary order sorting, even if the values are all
numbers. However, alternate sorting functions can be provided). Whereas
the length property returns a value when inspected, the sort() method
acts on the data in the array. Thus, we can use them like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>x = y.length; // sets x to the current value of the length property of an array y</code></li>
  <li><code>y.sort(); // modifies array y by sorting it's elements</code><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>A function is a sub-set of code that carries out a specialised
function.&nbsp; An unusual aspect of JavaScript is that functions can
be considered akin to variables in most contexts; thus an array element
might contain a function as well as a more standard data type.
Functions are defined using the <span style="font-style: italic;">function</span> keyword and set back results to the calling code using <span style="font-style: italic;">return</span>. Figure 4 shows a simple function.<br>
</p>
<div class="code_example">function square(x) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; return x*x;<br>
}<br>
</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4: A JavaScript function</p>
<p>This creates a function called <span style="font-style: italic;">square</span>, which will return the square of it's input parameter. We would use it like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>i = square(4); // sets i to the square of 4, i.e. 16</code></li>
  <li><code>x = square(y); // sets x to the square of the current value of y.<br>
    </code></li>
  <li><code>a = square(b+c); // b+c will be calculated first, and then the function will be called...<br>
    </code></li>
</ul>
<p>This Figure also illustrates an important part of the syntax of
JavaScript (and all C-like languages), that the curly brackets '{}' are
used to group together a series of statements. In this example the
function consists of only one line; most functions are more complex and
require several (possibly many) lines, and the brackets indicate where
the function code starts and ends.<br>
</p>
<h4>Operators</h4>
<p>The examples above have a contained a few examples of <span style="font-style: italic;">operators</span>,
tokens in the code which make the program do some sort of operation on
data items. Thus, we have seen that number data types can be
manipulated with the basic arithmetic operators +, -, * and /.&nbsp;
There are many other operators in JavaScript; we have already seen the
'new' operator that is used with objects, and the '[]' operator that is
used with arrays. It is beyond the scope of this introduction to go
through all operators in turn, but it is important to introduce a few
commonly used ones.</p>
<p>Two of the most commonly used - and most commonly <span style="font-style: italic;">confused</span>
- operators, are the assignment operator '=', the test for equality
'=='. The assignment operator is used when we assign a value to
variables.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>a = 1;</code></li>
  <li><code>mesg = 'Hello';</code></li>
  <li><code>x = y;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The test for equality is used in comparisons - usually in 'if'
statements - to check whether two values are the same, for example:</p>
<pre>if (x==y)<br>  a = a + 1;<br>else<br>  b = b + 1;<br></pre>
<p>A very easy mistake is to write the first line in this fragment as
'if (x=y)'.&nbsp; After all, this makes sense in English and
mathematical senses. This is not necessarily a bug - it is valid code -
although it is almost never what you intended. As '=' is the assignment
operator, this expression would first set x to be equal to the current
value of y. The operator would then return a value of 'true',
indicating that it had successfully carried out the assignment
operation. The true state would then cause the 'if' statement to be
validly interpreted, and the first alternative action would be taken.</p>
<p>A final pair of operators that should be mentioned in any brief
introduction are '++' and '--'. These are special unary operators
(meaning, they act on a single item) which increment or decrement a
variable by one.&nbsp; You will see them commonly used, especially in
loop counters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>i++; // increases the value of i by 1;</code></li>
  <li><code>j--; // decreases the value of j by 1</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Variable scope</h3>
<p>So far, this introduction has covered lexical issues (rules for the
format of the program and what characters and terms can be used), and
data types. The final part of this section discusses variable <span style="font-style: italic;">scope</span>.
The scope of a variable indicates the different parts of a program in
which it's value is defined.&nbsp; Variables defined within a function
are <span style="font-style: italic;">local</span> to that function,
and thus have no meaning when we leave the function to return to the
rest of the code. by contrast, a variable defined in the main body of
the program is termed a <span style="font-style: italic;">global</span>
variable. As the name suggests global variables are defined throughout
the program, and thus functions can 'see' the values of global
variables. The code in Figure 5 illustrates this.</p>
<div class="code_example">// A function<br>
function circleArea(j) {<br>
&nbsp; var i; // local scope<br>
&nbsp; i = pi * (j * 2);<br>
&nbsp; return i;<br>
}<br>
<br>
// Main program<br>
var pi = 3.14; // global scope<br>
var radius; <br>
var area;<br>
<br>
radius = 5;<br>
area = circleArea(radius);<br>
document.write("Radius:" + radius + " Area:" + area);<br>
</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 5: A program containing a function</p>
<p>The program in Figure 5 uses a function to calculate the area of a
circle. It illustrates a number of features. We have used the variables
<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span> and j in the function. <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span> takes the value of 'radius' that is passed in by the main program. The function calculates the answer as <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>. The variable <span style="font-style: italic;">pi</span> was defined in the main program and thus has global scope; it can therefore be used in the function. The variable <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>
is defined within the function, and has local scope; we cannot see the
value of this once we return to the main program; instead we set the
variable <span style="font-style: italic;">area</span> to the value returned by the function. In fact, we could have used variables called <span style="font-style: italic;">radius</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">area</span> in our function as well as in the main program. <br>
</p>
<p>If a function has local variables (declared using the <code>var</code> statement) that have the same name as global variables, they will take
precedence in the function.&nbsp; When we return to the main program,
we return to our original versions of the variables, which will have
retained their values, regardless of what might have happened in the
function. In contrast, if we refer to a variable without declaring it
in the function, we'll use (and possibly modify) the global variable of
that name. Clearly, it is fairly easy to make mistakes with scope, and
to unintentionally over-write the original value of global variables.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, it may be noted that the program uses the <code>write()</code> method of the special object <code>document</code> (which is always defined and available) to print a message to the screen.<br>
