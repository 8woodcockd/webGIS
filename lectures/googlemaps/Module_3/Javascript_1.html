<h1>Basic JavaScript</h1>

<h2>An
introduction to JavaScript<br> </h2> 

<p>JavaScript is a programming
language which is most widely used as a means of embedding executable
content in web pages, allowing a web page to interact with the user,
dynamically modify itself, and alter the general behaviour of the
browser. Interpreters for JavaScript are incorporated into all of the
well known web browsers. JavaScript can be used for a variety of
purposes. Early in its life-cycle, JavaScript developed a rather
poor reputation: it was often used to add unnecessary (and usually
irritating) bells and whistles to web pages. However, over time it has
come to be used widely in much more mature ways. Many of these are
useful, but not very exciting - automatic error checking in web forms,
for example. Other examples might be the instant updating of the
value of a shopping basket on a retail site. Complex applications
can also be constructed - for example web mail sites typically make
heavy use of JavaScript. And of course, JavaScript is central to Google Maps.
</p> 

<p>In terms of syntax, JavaScript
broadly resembles C and Java - if you've used either of those languages
(or others in the same syntax family, such as PHP) you'll recognise the
line layouts, the comment characters, the uses of different sort of
brackets and so on. In terms of language structure (rather than syntax)
however, it is different to those two languages. A notable difference is
that JavaScript is weakly typed, as opposed to the strong typing of
languages like C. What does this mean? In C, when you declare a
variable, you have to identify what sort of variable it is - an integer,
a character string, a floating point number etc. In JavaScript, this is
not necessary - you declare new variables and then can largely use them
as you like. This helps the beginner, although can lead to unexpected
results at times. JavaScript is an object-oriented language. We will
come to what this means later (although having completed Java, I'm sure you already know), but it is worth noting that objects do
not necessarily behave in the same manner as in other object-oriented
languages.<br> </p> 

<p>Despite the similar syntax, and the fact that
both languages are typically used to provide web content, JavaScript has
no relationship to the Java programming language. The language is
in some ways quite simple - short programs can be quickly developed -
and it is designed to be quite forgiving for new programmers.
However, the language also has a wide variety of features and
capabilities that permit the development of quite complex applications
as well.</p> 

<h3>History</h3> <p>JavaScript was first introduced in a
version of the Netscape Navigator web browser released in 1995, having
been briefly known as LiveScript. The Netscape Navigator web
browser enjoyed a dominant market position at the time (being more
advanced than rival products) and JavaScript grew rapidly in popularity;
the browser declined in popularity in the face of competition from
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, although a later version ultimately
became the original code base for Mozilla's Firefox browser.</p>

<p>Microsoft added a version of JavaScript called JScript to it's
Internet Explorer browser in 1996, and shortly after this Netscape
submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, a privately run
international standards organisation. Ecma published a formal
standard for a language specification in 1997, with a number of
revisions since then, the most recent being in 2009.</p> 

<p>Formally,
the language specified in Ecma's standards is known as ECMAScript, with
JavaScript and JScript being variant dialects of this language, although
in practice everyone refers to the language(s) collectively as
JavaScript.</p> 

<p>An implication of this history - and the important
aspect to note - is that the versions of JavaScript (or 'ECMAScript' if
we wish to be pedantic) in different browsers are different. If you do
extensive programming in JavaScript, you'll find that you come up
against these language incompatibilities, although in the work done in
this module they should not be a problem.</p>
