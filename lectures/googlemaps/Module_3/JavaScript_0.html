<h1>How should I learn JavaScript?</h1>
<p>
Nowadays there is a plethora of information on the web about learning Java Script.  A selection of resources can be found on the Readings page.
<p>
For this course, I would recommend you do the following:
<ul>
<li>Work your way through the extensive (and admittedly dry) notes that follow on this page AND
<li>Supplment this by playing with a more fun resource such as CodeAcademy.
</ul>

<h2>Code Academy</h2>

<a
href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Code Academy</a> is a website that provides
interactive tutorials that will quickly get you up to speed. 
<p>
Follow the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">link</a> and load up the website.  You should see the following:


<p>
<img src="CASignUp.png" alt="" style = "width:600px;height:400px">

<p>


Once you have signed up for an account, you will see:


<p>
<img src="CodeAcademy.png" alt="" style = "width:600px;height:400px">

<p>

Select JavaScript and off you go!
<p>
The HTML & CSS areas are also worth exploring for improving the look and feel of your website.
