<h2>Summary</h2>
In previous work with Google Maps, we looked at the way in which markers can be
created and added to a map. This week, we have looked at the process of
creating and adding polygons.&nbsp;We started by creating some very simple polygons
on a map, and then progressed on to making these polygons clickable, and to
have them coloured in different ways.<br>
<br>
The initial examples used simple squares for the sake of illustration. This is
not generally very useful, and so the next example used ward boundaries as an
example.&nbsp;It was demonstrated how these can be added to a map, although the
process of conversion from boundary data a given desktop GIS format to the form
that we want to use is not terribly easy.&nbsp;A more siginficant problem is that
only a small number of polygons can practically by added to a map.

<p>An alternative method - to be illustrated in future material - is to use a
KML layer. We can link to an external file of boundary and location data, and
render it as an overlay on our map. A number of products including ArcGIS can
export KML.</p>

<p>Another way around the problem is to convert the polygons into a raster
image, and to use that as an overlay.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a useful approach, and we have
looked at one tool which automates this procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;A disadvantage, compared to
the 'real' polygons being rendered as map elements in the earlier examples is
that the polygons are not clickable objects.</p>

<p>The final part of the lecture demonstrated the way in which a utility called
CASA Google Maps Creator was used to create a detailed overlay; we shall look
at the technical aspects of this next week.<br>

<h2>Practical</h2>
This week's <a href="https://vlebb.leeds.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/users/geo6odw/geog58705871_2010-11/wk8/geog5870_wk8_prac.html">practical</a> will cover the
polygon examples discussed in this week's lecture.<br>
