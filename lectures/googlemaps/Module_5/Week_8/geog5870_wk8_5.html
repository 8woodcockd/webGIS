<h1>GEOG5870M/GEOG5871M Web-Based GIS: Doing More With Google Maps [5]</h1>

<h2>Using a raster overlay</h2>

<p>One of the earlier examples showed how ward boundaries could be added to map
as polygon overlays.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, only 5 generalised wards were used, and it was
noted that this was close to the practical limit as to the number of polygons
that could be added to a map.This is not ideal - clearly we may want to add
many polygons to a map.<br>
</p>

<p>One approach is to create a raster image that can be used as an overlay
layer, in which the raster image contains depictions of the polygons involved.
&nbsp;Using this approach, a large number of&nbsp;polygons can be rendered, although it
may be necessary to break up the raster image into a number of tiles.<br>
</p>

<h3>Google Maps Creator</h3>

<div class="warnbox">
<p>Note: The version of Google Maps Creator used here produced code suitable
for Google Maps API V2 (rather than V3, as in the rest of this module). Version
2 of the API has some major differences - I am investigating how easy it is to
make the utility compatible with V3.</p>
</div>

<p>A useful tool is available from the <a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/">Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis</a>
(CASA) at UCL, which we will use for this example. &nbsp;Google Maps Creator can be
downloaded and installed on a PC (or Mac or Linux box), although administrator
rights are required to install (in Windows at least) [ It appears that it can
be installed as a regular user, but I experienced difficulties in running the
software when doing so ]. &nbsp;The package can be downloaded from:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/software/gmapcreator.asp">http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/software/gmapcreator.asp</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The package comes with help instructions, and so the process will be
outlined here only in brief.<br>
</p>

<p>The tool takes as input a ESRI Shapefile, so it is necessary to prepare a
coverage that you wish to use with ArcMap or equivalent. &nbsp;Google Maps Creator
allows you to select an attribute data item from the shapefile, and then use
this to shade the map. &nbsp;It is not possible to carry out any data
transformations within Google Maps Creator, so it is necessary to ensure that
any derived fields that are required have already been created in ArcMap.<br>
</p>

<p>On first loading Google Maps Creator, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">File / Open</span> command can be used to locate and
load a shapefile. &nbsp;This will be loaded and previewed on screen. &nbsp;It is then
necessary to choose a data item to use to shade the map. &nbsp;By default, shading
categories will be created between 0 and 1, regardless of the range of values
that are actually observed in the selected variable. &nbsp;The data ranges cannot be
explored in Google Maps Creator, so it is important to know the ranges of
observed values before starting.<br>
</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cols</span> button on the map interface
can be used to change the shading categories, and also to assign category
labels, and to change the colours used for shading.<br>
</p>

<p>On the right hand side of the map, a slider is used to select the maximum
zoom level for which tiles will be generated. &nbsp;The higher the zoom level, the
more detail will be apparent as a user zooms into the map created. &nbsp;However,
the number of tiles that are created increases rapidly with an increase in zoom
level, and so it is important to strike a balance between maximum zoom level
and the number of tiles to be generated.<br>
</p>

Figure 14:&nbsp;&nbsp;Using CASA Google Maps Creator</div>

<p>As an example, the shapefile containing Leeds Output Areas, with population
density added as a field was used with Google Maps Creator. &nbsp;This file was also
used in the examples using MapServer in <a href="https://vlebb.leeds.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/users/geo6odw/geog58705871_2010-11/wk3/index.html">week 3</a>
of this module.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 14 shows the state of the application when the
shapefile has first been loaded, and population density selected as the shading
variable.<br>
</p>

<p>A shading scheme was developed that used the same category boundaries and
same colours as were used in the MapServer example with the same data set.<br>
</p>

<p>The maximum zoom level was set to 13: this is not the maximum level that can
be zoomed to, but is a relatively small scale. &nbsp;Experimentation is required in
practice to help decide what the best setting for maximum zoom level will be
for any chosen application. &nbsp;You should not leave the setting at 0, as
otherwise you will not be able to zoom into the map that is created at all.<br>
</p>

<p>The Google Maps Creator application will create an html page and all the
associated files that are required to tile the shapefil on to a Google Map. The
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span> menu should be used to set the
correct API key for the use with the map (i.e. the API key you have registered
for a given directory). When the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create</span>
button is pressed, the application will generate the html page and associated
tile images in the same directory from which the original shapefile was read.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>

<p>The html file will be called <span style="font-style: italic;">shapefile_name.html</span>, and there will be a
directory <span style="font-style: italic;">shapefile_name-tiles</span> which
contains the image files used for presenting on the map. &nbsp;There will also be an
image created featuring the UCL logo. These files should then be moved to an
appropriate directory from which they can be served on the web.<br>

Figure 15:&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of Google Maps Creator example</div>

<p>Figure 15 shows the results of using the Leeds OAs shapefile with the CASA
Google Maps Creator.&nbsp;&nbsp;The map initially appears zoomed out to cover most of
Britain, and the Leeds raster layer is barely visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the user zooms into
Leeds, the raster overlay layer becomes more apparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 15b shows the
state of the map when it has been zoomed into the maximum extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;This zoom
level depends on the value selected for maximum zoom level in the Google Maps
Creator application.</p>
