<h1>School catchment areas</h1>
<p>This map shows catchment areas for a selection of secondary schools in Waltham Forest, using cut off distances as applied for intake in September 2010.</p>
<div class="gmap" id="map_canvas" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The colours of the map pins and the associated circles are randomly assigned.  If any particular pin is too dark, then the page can be re-loaded in order to assign new colours
<li>Not all schools are currently included on the map
<li>Some schools (those which are not over-subscribed) do not have a distance cut-off
<li>The distance data is taken from <a href="http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/guide%20to%20applying%20to%20a%20secondary%20school%202012.pdf">Moving on - a guide to applying 
for a secondary school place for September 2012</a> published by the London Borough of Waltham Forest
