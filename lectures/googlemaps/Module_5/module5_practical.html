	<h1>Practical</h1> <p> 
	
This module looked at the process
of adding lines and polygons as an overlay to a Google Map.  

<p>

The
first part of this practical is simply to re-create the
examples given in the lecture. Using the files listed for the polygon
examples, you should try to re-create the examples shown. The first
two of these examples, you will recall, are very simple, and create a
pair of square polygons. Try altering the characteristics of these
polygons. You might also try adding in some extra points. The third
example is more complex; it uses (simplified) ward boundary data to
create a number of polygons for wards in Leeds.  In places the
boundaries are a little crude (compared to the originals) and as the
polygons have been generalised independently of each other, they do
not always meet seamlessly.

<h2>Task </h2>
<p>
Get the first three examples working
properly. They can be found at the bottom of <a href="module5_3.html">this page</a>


<h2>Task</h2>
<p>We'll now look at a case with
more polygons.  This data file <a href="mapdata_leeds_eg2.js">mapdata_leeds_eg2.js</a> contains polygon data for all wards in
Leeds.  In terms of GIS data it is a small data set, but for a Google
Maps application it is relatively large and detailed.  The level of
performance with a large data set depends on the client capabilities
(i.e. the user's browser and computer) rather than on any server
capabilities.  However, this is not a fixed constraint: over time the
average computer becomes more powerful, and at the same time newer
versions of browser software bring better performance. 


<p> 
Using the
html and mapsetup files from example 3 below, generate a new example
using the mapdata_leeds_eg2.js data file. 


<ul>
      <li><a href="poly3.html">poly_eg3.html</a></li>
      <li><a href="poly_eg3_data.js">poly_eg3_data.js</a></li>
      <li><a href="poly_eg3_setup.js">poly_eg3_setup.js</a></li>
    </ul>

Ask yourself the following questions:
<ul>
<li> What is the
performance like on your browser? 
<li> Do you think that a data file
of this size is suitable for general use? All wards will be shaded
the same colour using this sample data.  
<li>  Can you think of ways of
experimenting with alternate shading?  
</ul>
<p>
You could download and append
some attribute data, or use an alternative approach such as a random
number generator. A random number can be generated in JavaScript
using Math.random() (e.g. var randNo = Math.random())
