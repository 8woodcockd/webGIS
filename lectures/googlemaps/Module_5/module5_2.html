<h1>Adding overlays</h1>


<p>Markers are an example of one sort of overlay that can be placed on top of
the background map in Google Maps. As we have seen in last week's material, it
is possible to alter the marker image ; one implication of this is that
different marker styles can be used to convey additonal information about the
location (e.g. markers of different colours could be used to chow different
types of location). There are a variety of alternative overlay s that can also
be used in Google Maps, and we will look at some of these this week.</p>

<h3>Creating and adding lines and polygons</h3>

<p>The Blue Plaques practical task, and most of the examples that we studied
earlier focused on using markers to represent information. These are ideal for
point level information, but not so good for area level information. An
obvious thing to want to do is to draw lines and polygons on the map. Figure 2
shows sample code for a map which will be drawn with a set of overlay lines.
Three files are illustrated.</p>

<p>The first of these is the HTML file which will contain our map. The HEAD
section contains links to a number of other files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Google Maps JavaScript API</li>
  <li>The JSCoord library used last week </li>
  <li>A JavaScript data file</li>
  <li>A JavaScript map setup file</li>
  <li>Two style sheets - a general one (intended for general page appearance)
    and a more map specific one</li>
</ul>

<p>The body of the HTML is much the same as in previous examples, although as
we will be drawing a map of the UK in this example, I have made the map_canvas
division long and thin.</p>

<p>The second file shown is an excerpt of a data file, showing the general
structure. This was converted from CSV exported from an Excel spreadsheet; all
values have been placed in quotes. The data are taken from the 2001 Census
Special Migration Statistics, and detail migration flows from different
districts of the UK to Leeds. The 'origin' value is simply a district number,
and the 'flow' value is the number of persons recorded in the Census who had
changed their usual residential address in the year prior to the census. For
each data value, the flow shows the number of people who lived in Leeds at the
time of the Census, and in the origin district one year before the Census.</p>

<p>The third file shown in the map set up file. This sets up a map in the same
way as done in the previous examples. It then iterates through a data set,
again as in previolus examples with markers. However, in this case we are doing
something different with the data: we are drawing lines on the map.</p>
<p>
There are links to each of these files near the bottom of the page.

<p>a) Ouput with initial line styles</p>

<p><img alt="Alternate line styles" src="leeds_sms_eg2.gif" width="508" height="709"></p>

<p>b) Output with revised line styles</p>


<p>The lines that have been added are called <em>polylines</em> in the Google
Maps API. Polyline is defined by a series of points; this map uses the simplest
of such lines, which are defined by only a start and an end point. Let us
return to the code shown in the map setup script above. The loop
'<code>for (id in os_flows) {}</code>' iterates through the data array, carry
out its body section once for each data point. The first task - as with the
Blue Plaques example from last week - is to convert the location data from OS
grid references to lat-lng data points. In this example, we construct a LatLng
object called <code>myOrig</code> from each point we read. Note that despite
the fact that the eastings and northings are quoted in the data file, and might
thus be thought of as strings, the latlng constructor is happy to treat them as
numeric values.</p>

<p>Next we draw the line. There are two stages to this. Firstly, we contstruct
a polyline object, using '<code>new google.maps.Polyline()</code>'. This
requires one paramter - an object which lists line co-ordinates and the various
options. The most important of these are the line co-ordinates. These are given
in the <code>path</code> property of the polyline options object. The path is
an array, containing a set of points, each of which is a
<code>google.maps.LatLng()</code> object. We use two points: the
<code>myOrig</code> point that has just been created (as converted from the OS
grid references), and a second point <code>myDest</code>. As this map shows
flows to one location only we define the destination once, and use the same
point each time in our path.</p>

<p>The other characteristics for a polyline are the colour, opacity and width
of the line. In this initial example, we have drawn all lines with the same
characteristics: opaque red lines of weight 2.</p>

<p>The second thing that we need to do is add the line that has now been
defined to the map. The is done in the statement:
'<code>flowLine.setMap(map);</code>'. We use the <code>setmap()</code> method
of the generic <code>google.maps.Polyline()</code> object to attach the line to
the map, giving the name of the map object to which we wish to attach the line.
</p>

<p>As you can see from the figure, the resulting map contains a mass of lines,
which does not tell us much apart from the fact that - like most large cities,
especially those with large universities, Leeds draws migrants from almost
everywhere in the country.</p>

<p>We can alter the setup program to change the line style for flows of
different size. The following figure shows excerpts from the code of a revised example.
Some changes have been made within the <code>initialize()</code> function.
Firstly, we have added three new variables, <code>myColor</code>,
<code>myOpacity</code> and <code>myWeight</code>; as we intend to alter these
characteristics for each line.</p>

<p>We have also added a set of statements into the for loop that cycles through
each data point. We have a series of <code>if {}</code> statements, which ste
up the line characteristics. These are structured so that large flows which
meet all the 'if' criteria (i.e. they're greater than 0, they're also greater
than 10 etc...) will over-write the previous values for <code>myColor</code>
etc.</p>

<p>The lines are set to be drawn in black (but thin, and fairly transparent) is
the flow is small, and in red (and thicker, and more opaque) is the flow is
larger. This stage is clearly in the arena of basic map design - one needs to
know something about the nature of the data being mapped and about the range of
possible values, and then try out various different line styles.</p>

<p>The output using this revised version is shown in the second figure above (with red and black lines). The map is
clearer, and it is possible to distinguish those origins from which the major
flows are drawn, although it is still quite crowded - a common result in maps
of this type. Further improvements might be made with changes to the line
styles, and we might also decide to only draw those lines that represent flows
above a certain threshold (say, 50 persons).</p>

<p>The files used in these two examples are available here:</p>

</ul>

<p>If you use copies of these, you may need to alter the relative paths in the
HEAD section to the JSCoord library and the CSS files.</p>

<p>As with any map, the framing page should give some sort of explanatory key
when lines are shown in different colours to convey some quantitative
meaning.</p>

     }
     if (os_flows[id].flow &gt; 100) {

       myOpacity = 0.7;
       myWeight = 2;
     }
     if (os_flows[id].flow &gt; 1000) {
       myColor = "#EE0000"; 
       myOpacity = 0.9;
       myWeight = 3;
     }

     var flowLine = new google.maps.Polyline({
       path: [myOrig,myDest],
       strokeColor: myColor,
       strokeOpacity: myOpacity,
       strokeWeight: myWeight
      });
      flowLine.setMap(map);
   }</pre>
</div>

<p>As described above, a polyline is a line made up of a number of segments (in
the above example, only one segment per line) defined as a set of co-ordinates.
The step from this to a <em>polygon</em> is straightforward: a polygon is a
line which returns to its initial starting point. Polygons have the additional
characteristic beyond a line in that the y can have a fill colour (and variable
fill opacity) as well as line characteristics.</p>

<p>The following figure shows the code of a set of files which illustrate the construction
of basic polygons. The structure of these files is similar to those that we
used before, but we will run through their contents.<br>
</p>

<p>The HTML file <span style="font-style: italic;">wk8_poly_eg1.html</span> is
illustrated first. It is very similar to the file use in the line drawing
above, differing only in the names of the files loaded, and the on-page
text.</p>

<p>The second file is a data file. It defines two polygons with some basic
details, and a <code>boundary</code> property which contains an array of grid
reference points.</p>

<div class="code_example">
<p><strong>wk8_poly_eg1.html</strong></p>
<img src = "eg4.png" height="250" width="600">

<p><strong>wk8_poly_eg1_data.js</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>wk8_poly_eg1_setup.js</strong></p>
<img src = "eg6.png" height="600" width="700">


<p>The final file illustrated above is <span style="font-style: italic;">wk8_poly_eg1.js</span>. Again, it is broadly
similar to the previous examples. Instead of drawing lines or creating markers,
the main loop in the initialize() function will create some polygons. For each
iteration of the loop, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We create the variable <code>polyPath</code> as an empty array. This will
    contain the <code>path</code> that defines the polygon.</li>
  <li>We copy the <code>boundary</code> property of the current object being
    read from the data array. (We could work directly on
    <code>os_polydata[id].boundary</code> below; this stage is done to make the
    code easier to read).</li>
  <li>We start a new loop (nested inside the main loop that is processing the
    data file) to read through the boundary object.</li>
  <li>For each point, we follow the previously illustrated process of
    conversion from OS grid reference to WGS84 Latlng.</li>
  <li>We add the new point to our path. This is done using
    <code>polyPath.push(<em>point</em>)</code>. <code>push()</code> is a method
    attached to the generic Array object, and it adds the argument (in our
    case, a point) to the end of the array</li>
  <li>Having finished processing all of the boundary points, we construct a new
    <code>google.maps.Polygon()</code> object. This takes a number of
    parameters. The stroke parameters refer to the boundary line, whilst the
    fill parameters refer to the middle of the polygon.</li>
  <li>We add the polygon to the map using the setmap() method of the Polygon
    object (in the same way as we did with the lines).</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The map generated in this example is shown above. It can be seen that
the polygons are simple squares, with a solid red outline and semi-opaque
fill.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>On this page, we have seen examples of how we can add lines and polygons to
a map. The lines example showed how a reasonably large number of lines can be
added, whilst the polygon example used a simpler case. In the case of polygons,
we can generate complex polygons as well as these very simple examples - you
may note that the boundary data was added to the polygon property
<code>paths</code> rather than <code>path</code> as was the case with the
polyline. With polygons, we can add multiple paths, and thus have polygon
objects with more than one component; we can also define polygons with 'holes'
in them.</p>

<p>On the next page , we shall look at how we can add information to
polygons.</p>
