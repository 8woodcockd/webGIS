# Introduction

OSGeo Live is an operating system designed for teaching and disseminating
free open source software for geospatial applications
(FOSS4G as its affectionately known by the community).
OSGeo Live contains an impressive array of GIS tools in
its suite of **50** GIS programs. Thanks to automatic updates, the user
will have access to cutting edge GIS functionality, including map servers,
desktop GIS and geographical database systems. It's easier to run many
of these programs from OSGeo Live than on your existing operating system
because everything is already set-up and running. OSGeo can save a LOT of
time downloading disparate GIS tools. For an overview of OSGeo Live,
take a look around its website: [http://live.osgeo.org/](http://live.osgeo.org/).

OSGeo Live is free to download, install, use for any application you like
(including commercial applications) and is increasingly used in classrooms
around the world. It is a mature product released roughly every 2 years
and is under active development thanks to the oversight of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org/) (OSGeo). The name explains well the purpose
of OSGeo Live: to showcase projects supported OSGeo in a real life, 'Live'
setting.

OSGeo Live is a stable operating system suitable for most computing jobs.
If fact this tutorial was written on an OSGeo Live computer!

# Getting OSGeo Live

There are 3 main options to
get OSGeo Live running on your computer, as described
[here](http://live.osgeo.org/en/download.html):

1. [Install a bootable `.iso` file on your computer](http://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/osgeolive_install_quickstart.html) as a
*bootable* operating system. This option involves *partitioning* your
hard drive. This has the advantage of keeping OSGeo Live on your computer
at all times and fast to load.

2. Running OSGeo Live from a 'bootable' USB stick. This makes OSGeo slower to
run but has the advantage of making the system more portable (you can boot
it from any computer that has boot access) and less likely to disrupt your
computer

3. Running OSGeo Live from VirtualBox. This option is described [here](http://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/virtualization_quickstart.html) and has
many advantages for first-time or educational OSGeo users.

# A tour of OSGeo Live

Following this brief
[presentation](http://live.osgeo.org/en/presentation/index.html#/), we'll proceed
to get practical by exploring an instance of OSGeo Live *in the wild*.
Let's take a look at what it can do!
