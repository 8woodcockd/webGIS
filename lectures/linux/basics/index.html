<h1>Linux: basics</h1>

<P>
This session will take you through the basics of Linux, an operating system commonly used to 
run webservers.
</P>
<P>
You're advised to read through Part 1  first. After this, you can either have a go at 
installing your own version of Linux, or you can login to a pre-installed Linux system during the 
practicals. Once you have an OS to play with, you should then read through Part 2 and 3.
