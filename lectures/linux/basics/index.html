<h1>Linux: basics</h1>

<P>
This session will take you through the basics of Linux, an operating system commonly used to
run webservers.
</P>
<P>
You're advised to read through Part 1  first. After this, you should login to our pre-installed Linux system.
Once you have an OS to play with, you should then read through Part 2 and 3, trying out some of the commands (you'll ne able to navigate round, just not use
the commands demanding superuser access).

<H2>More information</H2>
<P>
For more information on Linux, especially Linux administration, good starter
books include
<A href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-All---One-Dummies-Computer/dp/1118844351/">Linux All-in-One For Dummies</A>and <A href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Complete-Reference-Richard-Petersen/dp/007149247X/">Linux: The Complete Reference</A>, though almost any similar book covering installation and security will do. Also, there's a good basic Unix tutorial at
<A href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">Surrey University's Electronic Engineering dept</A>.

<H2>Installing Linux</H2>
<P>
If you're interested in installing your own copy of Linux, we'll look at this later in the course when we look at OSGeo-Live.
