<h1>Server Side Technologies</h1>

<h2>1.0 An Introduction to Server-Side Technologies</h2>

<p>The first half of this course focussed heavily on client-side technologies such as HTML, 
CSS, Javascript and existing Javascript libraries. These technologies are named as such because 
they are performed by the client in the <a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server_model'>
client-server</a> model. A client is a piece of software(usually a web browser) which operates on the 
local system and makes <a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol'>Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </a> requests to a server as necessary. Client-side technologies can be faster 
and safer than server-side technologies; however they are limited in functionality and cannot interact 
with permanent storage such as a database. If your web-application requires permanent storage, for example 
you want users to add to an existing dataset or pull information that is stored centrally, server-side 
technologies are required to complete these processes. </p>

<p>The term ‘server-side technologies’ can encompass a range of software solutions, mainly:; server-side 
scripting languages; Database Management Systems (DBMS); web server software such as Apache; and many other 
technologies depending upon the application being built. The essential combination of technologies required 
to build a service is known as a ‘software-solution stack’ and the original and most commonly used web-service 
software solution stack is known as <a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)'>LAMP</a> 
(Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). The 4 components of this stack are now so interchangeable that hundreds of 
other acronyms are used to define different web-service solution stacks (WAMP uses Windows for example, 
MAMP uses Mac OS X). It is worth noting that the stack must include 4 components: a client; a web-server 
instance; a DBMS and a server-side scripting language.</p> 

<ul>
	<li>L – This component refers to the server’s operating system, in this case Linux. Now commonly 
		interchangeable with Windows (WAMP), or Mac OS X (MAMP). </li>
	<li>A – <a href = 'http://www.apache.org/'>Apache</a> is still the most commonly used 
		web-server software; however others are available such as <a href = 'http://wiki.nginx.org/Main'>NGINX.</a></li> 
	<li>M – <a href = 'http://www.mysql.com/'>MySQL</a> is an open-source and widely used Relational 
		Database Management System (RDBMS). It is now commonly interchangeable with <a href = 'http://www.postgresql.org/'>
		PostgreSQL</a>, <a href = 'https://sqlite.org/'>SQLite</a> or <a href = 'https://www.oracle.com/database/'>
		Oracle.</a></li>
	<li>P – <a href = 'http://php.net/'>PHP</a> is a server side scripting language that has the ability to connect to and 
		query a database using query language (such as SQL for MySQL, or PGSQL for PostgreSQL). PHP has extensive 
		functionality and is now interchangeable with other server-side scripting languages such as 
		<a href = 'https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>Ruby</a>, <a href = 'https://www.python.org/'>Python</a> or 
		<a href = 'https://www.perl.org/'>Perl.</a> </li>
</ul>

For the purposes of this part of the course, the software solution stack we will be using is Windows, Apache, 
PostgreSQL and PHP. We will be using these technologies to extract tweet data from a database and create a web map 
to display the geo-located tweets. We will cover each of the stack solution components in greater detail, 
but for now, it is important that you understand the client-server relationship and how these different technologies 
are involved. To explain how the software solution stack works in greater detail, let’s imagine how the Facebook 
log-in process works: </p>

<ol>
	<li>The Facebook login URL is entered in a web browser address bar which initiates a HTTP request from the 
		client machine to Facebook’s server which is running the Apache web server software </li> 

	<li>Upon receiving the request, the Facebook Apache Server responds with a HTTP response 
		containing a static webpage which has a log-in form. </li>

	<li>Log-in credentials are entered on the client and the ‘Submit’ button is clicked which calls a server-side 
	PHP file. The PHP file establishes a secure connection to the Facebook server-side Database Management System 
	using a query language such as SQL.</li>

	<li>Once a secure connection has been established an SQL query is called which checks if the user-credentials 
	match a user in the database. If so, a series of server-side processes occur to compile the user profile and 
	display it in the browser. If not, PHP returns an error and the user is asked to try again.</li> 

<p>Now we have looked at how these technologies interact with one another let’s look at some of the components 
in greater detail, we can then consider how our web-map service will be constructed.</p>
