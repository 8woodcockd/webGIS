<h1>Server Side Technologies</h1>

<h2>2.0 The Apache HTTP Server</h2>

<p>The second component of the web-service solution stack is the Apache HTTP server. Apache is the worldâ€™s most commonly 
used web-server software and over 54% of all web servers are currently running Apache.   
The Apache software and its documentation are developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation; 
a group of volunteers located across the world. Apache was the first web server software to serve more than 
100 million websites and played a crucial role in the initial growth of the 
<a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web'>World Wide Web.</a> </p>

<p>Apache can be configured to suit the needs of the user / application and is 
<a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache_modules'>highly extensible.</a> 
For this part of the course, we are using a server hosted at the University called dialogplus which 
runs Apache. You have each been provided with a directory on this server where you will keep your files. 
Usernames and Passwords have been provided on the VLE. You can think of this server as an alternative to 
the personal server which was used for the first half of the course.</p>
