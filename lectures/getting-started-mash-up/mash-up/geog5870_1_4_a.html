<h1>Google Maps: An Introduction</h1>

<h2>How mashups work</h2>

<p>As described previously, mashups have a generic structure that they integrate
data from external (to Google) sources with a Google map base. The external
sources may well be, and often are, also external to the producers of the
mashup, although this does not necessarily have to be the case. Simple
composite maps, that is, maps with new information, can be created by
importing a KML (or other file format such as .csv and .xml) into Google
<a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/">My Maps</a>. <a
href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/">My Maps</a> is a relatively
new product from Google that allows you to create custom maps to share
online.  You can do this either by clicking on the maps, or creating a
KML file.  As we are hard-core webby's, we'll do both in the tutorial!   
<p>
Prior to 2014/15, KML's worked by supplying the map interface the URL of a KML
file - that is, by typing the URL into the query box on the
maps.google.co.uk homepage.  However, this service is being ended in
February 2015, so if you have created KML's in this way previously,
abandon that knowledge!</p>

<p>KML files were originally used to store data for an application called
Keyhole, which became the virtual global application Google Earth. One or more
points can be defined in a KML file, and imported into <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/">My Maps</a>. An example
of a KML file (download <a href ="kml_eg1.kml"> here</a>) is shown below<br>

<p>In this example, two locations ('Placemarks') are defined. Each placemark
has a name, a description and - most importantly - a location. The locations
are given in longitude and latitude and in decimal degrees rather than degrees
minutes and seconds (i.e. 53.807836, rather than 53Â° 48' 28.21"). Two points
are defined in this example, located on the main building of the School of
Geography, and the East Building.</p>

<p>If the above file was placed on a web server, then a link to the file could
be imported into My Maps, and the resulting map would contain
markers at the two points. This is a useful facility, as anyone can create a
file in this format, publish it, and then use it to map the data. The format is
regular, and thus it would be easy to write a program that took some source
data with a large number of points, and created a KML file with entries for all
the original points.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of many examples where data could be easily
plotted using this approach. However, it is ultimately limited, in that
there is little control over the presentation of markers or other map
elements.  However, saying this, creating customised maps with <a
href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/">My Maps</a> has more
flexibility and allows info boxes and other social media formats to be
easily added in, but much more can
be done by interacting with Google Maps API. The API (Application Programming
Interface) is a means by which you can interact directly with the Google Maps
server, and produce a map using the same functions and routines that the
general Google Maps application uses itself. This can be done using a number of
programming languages, including client-side Javascript and server-side
languages such as PHP. By 'client-side', we mean that the language is
interpreted and processed by the client application - in this case, a web
browser. By 'server-side' we mean a language that is processed on a web server,
in order to dynamically produce the contents of a web page, before sending that
web page to the client.<br>

In the tutorial associated with this module, you will be creating your own KML files.
