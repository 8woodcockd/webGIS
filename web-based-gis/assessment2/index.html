<h1>Google Maps Assessed practical</h1>
<p>
The practical task for unit 4 involved the construction of a map showing the locations of Blue Plaques in Leeds, marking the locations of buildings with a significant history. 


<h2>Assessed task</h2>
<p>

Using the Google Maps techniques that you have learnt, you should develop your own version of the Leeds Blue Plaques map. You can enhance the general appearance of the map and web page however you think appropriate, and can link to further sites if you wish.

<p>
<ul>
<li>	The web page should be written for a general audience and should thus contain contextual information about the plaques and their use.
<li>	The site can use multiple web pages if you wish.
<li>	Data sources should be cited.
<li>	You should study the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps JavaScript API</a> reference material to learn more about options controlling the appearance of such features as markers and infowindows.
</ul>

<p>
The assessed work counts for <b>20%</b> of the overall module mark

<h2>Submission details</h2>

The assessment for this practical will be based on the web page/s that you create for the above task. A short document should be submitted via the VLE, which gives details of the URL of your map. You will also be asked to submit:
