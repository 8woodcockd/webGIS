<h1>GEOG5870M/GEOG5871M Web-based GIS: Project work</h1>

<h2>Overall task</h2>
<p>

You should create a website that contains a significant mapping component that is based on one of the technologies that have been discussed in the module.
The website should show the spatial distribution of some data of interest, or should demonstrate some aspect of theory in geography or a similar spatial science. For example, some student projects in previous years have included:
<ul>
<li>Locations and details of historic monuments in Latvia
<li>Locations and details of protected trees in Devon
<li>Analysis of crime event data
<li>A demonstration of the travelling salesman problem
<li>Automatic viewshed calculation
</ul>
<p>
The website can be presented as a pilot version of a site that might be developed if you had greater time and resources.
<p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
<ul><li>The project may make use of primary data (data that you have collected yourself) or of secondary data (data that has already been collected and published by others)
<li>You should ensure that you are permitted to publically use all relevant data sets
<li>Your project can be hosted on either of the University servers used during the module, or on a separate facility of your own choosing, as long as this is generally accessible
<li>The server www.personal.leeds.ac.uk does not, unfortunately, permit serverside storage of data. This prevents the development of sites that store information supplied by users. If you would like to create such a site, it is recommended that you simulate some typical user input, and present the site as a pilot or proof-­‐of-­‐concept approach
 </ul>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>
The outputs of the task should be:
<enumerate><li>The website itself
<li>A technical report that describes how you constructed the website
</enumerate>
<p>
As well as the map based elements, the website should contain supporting written material that describe the phenomena illustrated in the map, and indicates why it is of interest. This should include reference to academic literature where possible.
The technical report should be written as if you were delivering a progress report to an employer. It should include information on the software used, problems encountered, and ways in which the site may be improved in future.
<p>
Mark allocation
<p>

Website	<b>80%</b>
Technical report	<b>20%</b>
<p>
The technical report will be marked against the following criteria:
<ul><li>Understanding of task;
<li>Structure;
<li>Clarity of argument;
<li>Breadth of content;
<li>Reading and referencing;
<li>Writing style.
</ul>
<p>
The website will be based on similar criteria:
<ul>
<li>Fitness (does it work?);
<li>Structure / website navigation;
<li>Technical merit;
<li>Breadth of online content;
<li>Referencing (including citation of sources);
<li>Writing / presentation.
</ul>
<p>
In both cases, the weight assigned to each criterion will vary. The project itself contributes 60% of the final module mark.
<p>
<h2>Data sets</h2>
<p>
The website should incorporate further data that is presented as addition to the main base map. The source of this data is up to you, although you should remember to fully cite the sources of all data used.
<h2>Original data</h2>
<p>It may be the case that you wish to create some original data to use in your website. This may created via primary collection (for example, using a GPS unit), via user contribution for a website that allows third parties to interact with a map, through creation of a synthetic data set that demonstrates some principle, or through other means. Students may collaborate on aspects such as primary collection of data if they wish, but should note that following qualifications:
<ul><li>You should inform the course convenor in advance if you intend to collaborate on any sort of data collection or generation.
<li>Each student must create their own website for the assessed mark that is entirely distinct from, and independent of any other student’s site.
</ul>
Please upload the technical report and files associated with the website as a zip file using the 'Zip file upload' option of Turnitin.
