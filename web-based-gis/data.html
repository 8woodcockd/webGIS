<h2>Blue Plaques data</h2>
<p>A book by John Stillwell and Rachael Unsworth (Around Leeds, A Guide to the City Centre, Leeds University Press, Leeds, 2008) discusses the development of Leeds as a city, including rapid recent growth.  As part of the preparatory work for the volume, data were collected on Blue Plaques in and around Leeds. This data file is available here:
